<h3 id="H_INDIC">HOIST INDICATORS</h3>
</div>

<p><b>1. The hoist indicator</b> is a mechanism attached to the drum
shaft of a hoisting engine to show the hoisting engineer the position
of the cage or skip in the shaft throughout the time of hoisting. The
use of such indicators is sometimes required by law, but there is a
great diversity of opinion as to the advisability of using them. The
objections to them are that they are liable to get out of order, and
that in general the use of any automatic device that tends to relieve
the hoisting engineer of responsibility and constant attention to his
engine is not to be commended. A hoisting engineer, however, depends
for his stopping point mainly on a mark made on the rope, or on the
drum, or on both, and uses an indicator mostly as a guide for the
position of the cage during the hoist.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>TYPES OF INDICATORS</b></p>

<p><b>2. Column Indicators.</b>&mdash;A very simple indicator, and one that
was formerly very commonly used, is made by inserting a pin into the
center of the end of the drum shaft and using this as a miniature
drum on which to wind and unwind a chain or cord, which corresponds
to the hoisting rope as the pin corresponds to the drum. This chain
or cord is led over a pulley placed at the top of a pair of guides,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
representing the shaft, and carries at its end a weight, pointer, or
gong, representing the cage or car, as shown in <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <img id="FIG_1" src="images/i_002a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="515" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="figsub">
   <img  id="FIG_2" src="images/i_002b.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="510" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>The different landings in the shaft are marked on the guide; and as
the pointer or gong rises and falls it indicates the position of the
cage in the shaft. If a gong is used, pointer also may be added and
the gong so arranged that it will ring at a point some distance before
the landing is reached and thus attract the engineer’s attention.
Indicators of this kind, though cheap and easily constructed, are not
reliable, for the cord and chain may stretch or they may overlap in
winding on the pin, or may bind in the pulley and thus indicate a wrong
position of the cage.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> An indicator should have a positive motion and be driven by
gearing or by link belts. <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a> shows a <b>column indicator</b>
that consists of a screw <i>a</i> working inside of a slotted pipe <i>b</i>,
which may be of any length necessary. This screw is revolved by means
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
of the gears <i>c</i>, which are rotated by the sprocket wheel
<i>d</i>. A nut <i>e</i> travels up and down the screw <i>a</i> and
the pointer <i>f</i> attached to the nut indicates the position of the
cage in the shaft. The pipe standard <i>b</i> is usually painted a dead
black and the different levels may be marked on it with chalk or white
paint. Chalk marks are not safe, as they may be tampered with and the
engineer thus misled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_3" src="images/i_003a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="264" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p>
  </div>

<p>The pointer <i>a</i>, <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>, is moved by the rotation of
the screw shaft <i>b</i>, which is revolved by the bevel gears <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i>. This indicator also registers the number of hoists by means
of the dials <i>e</i>, for at each hoist the lower end of the pointer
a engages a ratchet wheel behind the two dial faces shown and thus
registers on the dial.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_4" src="images/i_003b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="260" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span></p>
  </div>

<p><b>4. Dial Indicators.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a> shows a positive-motion
indicator that is operated as follows: A worm <i>a</i> on the drum shaft <i>b</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
engages with the worm-wheel <i>c</i> on the small shaft <i>d</i> that
is supported by the bearings <i>e</i>. The pointer <i>f</i> is rigidly
attached to the shaft <i>d</i> and revolves in front of the properly
marked dial <i>g</i>.</p>

<p id="ART_5"><b>5.</b> <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a> shows a <b>dial indicator</b> attached to
drum hoists where the speed of rope is constant for each revolution. The wheel
<i>a</i> of this indicator may be a worm-wheel working in a worm on the
drum shaft, as described in connection with the indicator shown in <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>,
or it may be a sprocket wheel driven by a link belt from a sprocket
wheel on a drum, or it may be a gear-wheel driven directly from another
gear-wheel on the drum. The gear-wheels <i>b</i> revolve a vertical
shaft <i>c</i> fitted at the upper end with a worm <i>d</i> that drives
the worm-wheel <i>e</i> placed on the end of the pointer spindle. The
different levels from which hoisting is to be done may be painted on
the dial, or better, they may be placed on movable targets that are
clamped to the dial and can thus be moved as occasion requires.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_5" src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="540" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot space-below2">
<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;An indicator is desired
for a shaft 800 feet deep at which the drum of the hoisting engine to
be used is 10 feet in diameter; what ratio of gearing must be used so
that the pointer will make one revolution during the hoist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solution.</span>&mdash;The circumference of the
drum is 31.42 ft. (π<i>D</i> = 10 × 3.1416 = 31.416 ft.); hence, the
revolutions per hoist are 800 ÷ 31.42 = 25.46 revolutions. Then, if the
pointer is to make one revolution per hoist, the ratio of the gearing
will be 25.46 to 1. Ans.</p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Special Indicators.</b>&mdash;One fault of nearly all indicators is
that they give a regular movement throughout the winding, and the space
over which the pointer travels is too small to enable the engineer to
land the cage accurately. Indicators have been made with a differential
motion to the pointer, the motion being greater at the time of landing
and less during the middle of the hoist. They are also made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span> with two
pointers, one operating like the dial indicator above described and the
other remaining stationary during all the hoist but the last few feet,
when it moves around its circle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_6" src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="561" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>7.</b> Where flat ropes are used or where round ropes wind on a
conical drum, the length of rope wound or unwound is different for each
turn of the drum. With all the indicators thus far described, while the
speed with which the indicator moves is proportional to the speed at
which the drum and the drum shaft revolve, it is not proportional to
the speed of the rope when winding and unwinding on a conical drum or
on a flat rope reel. <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)</a> shows
two views of a compensating dial indicator. By means of the spiral form of sheave
<i>c</i>, the hand <i>d</i> is made to move equal distances around the

disk <i>e</i> for equal distances of cage movement in the shaft. The
rope <i>f</i> passes about the spiral sheave and one end is attached at
the small end <i>g</i> of the spiral, while the other end is fastened
to the periphery of the sheave <i>h</i>, which takes its motion from
the drum shaft or crank-shaft of the hoisting engine by means of the
bevel gear <i>i</i>. Consequently, while the sheave <i>h</i> has a
regular motion dependent directly on the revolution of the hoisting
drum, the pointer <i>d</i> moves irregularly, depending on the position
of the spiral sheave <i>c</i>; that is, whether a small or large
diameter of the spiral is presented to the rope. The rope <i>j</i>
carrying the counterweight <i>k</i> is attached to a small circular
drum <i>l</i> that is on the same shaft as the spiral sheave. The
purpose of this cord and counterweight is to keep the indicator line
<i>f</i> taut and to bring the indicator back to position as the cord
<i>f</i> unwinds from the sheave <i>h</i>.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> In order that the pointer may not stand at exactly the same
point on the dial when the cage is at the top and at the bottom, and
so that the engineer may be able to distinguish between the top and
the bottom positions of the cage by the pointer, the ratio of the
gearing is usually increased by allowing one or two extra teeth on the
worm-wheel. In the example in <a href="#ART_5"><b>Art. 5</b></a>, assume a ratio
of 27: 1; that is, if a worm-gear is used, the worm-wheel will have 27 teeth.</p>

<p>If the pitch of the teeth is ¾ inch, the circumference of the pitch
circle will be ¾ × 27 = 20.25 inches and the diameter 6.44 inches.</p>

<p>The pitch of the worm will, of course, be the same as that of the
wheel, and its diameter will be whatever is necessary to give
sufficient strength outside of the shaft, since it bears no relation to
the ratio of the gearing.</p>

<h3 id="DRUMS">DRUMS AND REELS</h3>

<p><b>9.</b> The <b>drum</b>, or <b>reel</b>, of a hoisting engine is the
part on which the rope winds. It is either keyed fast to the engine
shaft or is connected to the shaft by means of a clutch, the shaft
being made extra heavy to carry the strain due to the weight of the
drum and the pull of the rope.

<p><b>11.</b> The shell may be cast in one piece for small drums or built
up in sections for large drums, as in Figs. <a href="#FIG_7">7</a>
and <a href="#FIG_8">8</a>. The shell may have
a smooth surface, <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a>, or it may have grooves,
<a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a>, for the rope
to lie in as it is wound on the drum. On an iron drum without grooves,
the rope will chafe sidewise; and furthermore if the rope winds on a
hard flat surface it bears here and there on a single wire and tends to
flatten, causing internal wear between the wires; while, in the case
of a rope winding in a groove, it is supported on about one-quarter of
its circumference, bringing many more wires to bear on the drum and
dividing the pressure between them. A wooden-lagged drum causes less
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
wear on a rope than an ungrooved iron-shell drum, as grooves are
gradually worn in the lagging, but is not so good as a grooved iron
drum. It is not good practice to allow a rope to wind on itself, and
the drum should be long enough to take the full length of the rope
required for the hoist. At least two turns of the rope should be on
the drum when the load is at the bottom, as the friction between the
rope and drum thus greatly lessens the strain coming on the rope at
the point where it is fastened to the drum. Allowance for two or three
additional turns of the rope should also be made so that the cage may
be hoisted above the landing.</p>

<p><b>15. Hoisting With Conical Drums.&mdash;Conical drums</b> are designed to
make the work of the engine as nearly uniform as possible throughout
the hoist. To accomplish this, when the cage is at the bottom of the
shaft, and the load is therefore heaviest, the rope winds on that part
of the drum having the smallest diameter. As hoisting continues, the
rope winds on a gradually increasing diameter of drum, and when the
cage is at the top of the hoist, and the load therefore least, the
rope is winding on that part of the drum having the greatest diameter;
in this way, the moment of the load at every point of the hoist is
approximately the same. The great difference in the loads at different
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
parts of the hoist is due mainly to the variation in the weight of the
rope hanging from the drum; hence, the less the weight of the rope in
proportion to the total load on the engine, the more nearly uniform is
the load on the engine.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a> shows a combined conical and cylindrical drum; an
unusual feature is the rope reel shown at each end of the drum, which permits
of properly storing a few hundred feet of extra rope, allowing the rope

<p><b>19. Comparison of Cylindrical and Conical Drums.</b> The
disadvantages of the cylindrical drum lie entirely in the fact that the
load on the engines is variable, but it is possible to overcome this
disadvantage by adding a tail-rope to the cages to balance the weight
of the rope. This system gives its best results where hoisting is done
from one level only, but in deep hoisting it is impracticable because
of the extra weight added and because of possible excessive swaying of
the rope.</p>

<p>The conical drum has two strong points in its favor: first, the load on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
the engine may be nearly equalized during the entire hoisting period;
and, second, the starting of the engines with the load requires less power.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of the conical drum are as follows: To maintain a
certain average speed of hoisting, the speed toward the end of the
hoist is of necessity higher than the average and comes at a time
when a slowing up should be taking place, so that more care must be
exercised when making the landing. To prevent the rope from being
drawn out of the grooves, the latter must be made deep and with a
large pitch, thereby increasing the width of the face or length of
the drum. In making a landing, when the rope is on the conical face,
the rope must be kept taut, as any slackness will permit the rope to
leave the groove, with the result that all the rope will pile up in the
bottom grooves of the drum allowing the cage to drop into the mine,
unless it is resting on the chairs. If there are several levels to be
hoisted from, the equalizing of the load on the engines can only be
realized for one level; for all other levels this advantage will be
lost. For large depths, conical drums become very long and require
correspondingly long leads from head-frame to drum. To hold the same
amount of rope, conical drums are heavier than cylindrical ones, and as
a result, the power required in starting the load is somewhat increased
owing to the greater inertia of the rotating parts.</p>

<p>Some of these disadvantages have been overcome by making a combination
of cone and cylindrical drums. The drums are so designed that the
landing takes place only when the rope is on the cylindrical portion
of the drum. For deep hoisting, the greater diameter of the drum and
its length must be inconveniently large if the load is equalized.
The length and diameter can be reduced by making one-half of the
drum cylindrical and by having the rope from each end wind on the
same cylindrical portion of the drum. In all cases, however, these
modifications are made at the expense of the equalization of the load
on the engines, and it is not possible to obtain the latter without
including some serious disadvantage.</p>

<p>There are certain objections to both cylindrical and conical drums:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
their great size and weight, for large hoists, make them very
expensive; their width necessitates placing the engines far apart,
which adds to the cost of the engines, foundations, and buildings; the
great weight of the drums is also objectionable, because it forms a
large part of the mass to be put in motion and brought to rest at each hoist.</p>

<h3 id="FLAT">FLAT ROPE REELS</h3>

<p><b>20</b>. To overcome the objections to conical and cylindrical drums,
several other systems of hoisting have been tried, among them being
one that uses a reel, <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>, and a flat rope. The hub
<i>a</i> is increased in diameter, above what is necessary for strength, to
such a size as is suitable to wind the rope on. It is then cored out from the
inside, so as not to contain too great a mass of metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_12" src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="429" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p>
</div>

<p>The arms <i>b</i> of the reel extend radially from the hub to confine
the rope laterally when it is all wound on the drum. These arms are
connected at their outer ends by a continuous flange <i>c</i>, which
flange is flared out, as shown at <i>d</i>, so as to take in the rope
easily, if it is deflected at all sidewise.</p>

<p>In the larger-sized reels, the arms are bolted to the hub, and often
the outer rim connecting the arms is omitted. Hardwood lining was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
formerly used on the arms under the impression that the wear on the
rope would be less than with bare iron arms, but sand and grit become
embedded in the wood and grind the rope. Polished iron arms with
rounded corners and lubricated with oil or tar are best. The end of the
rope is fastened in a pocket <i>e</i> provided for it in the hub.</p>

<p>The rope winds on itself, so that the diameter of the reel increases
as the hoist is made and as the load due to the weight of the rope
decreases. This serves to equalize the load due to the rope in the same
manner as the conical drum. Two reels are generally put on the same
shaft, and while one is hoisting from one compartment of the shaft the
other is lowering into another compartment. The periphery of the hub
where the rope winds should not be round but of gradually increasing
radius, for if a flat rope be wrapped about a round hub the rope will
have to abruptly mount itself at the end of the first revolution and so
on for every revolution. The radius of the hub should increase at such
a rate as to raise the rope an amount equal to its thickness in the
first wrap, so that it will wind on itself without jar at the point of
attachment, as well as on succeeding wraps.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> In America, it is customary to wind on reels of small
diameter, that is, starting at 3 or 5 feet and increasing to 8 or 12
feet; but several large plants have been built with reels starting
at 8 feet and increasing to 19 feet. In England, reels have been
made starting at 16 feet and increasing to 20 or 22 feet. Such large
reels are easier on the rope but require large engines, as hoisting
in balance is used to only a slight extent. The large reel is easy on
the rope, both from the fact that it bends the rope but little and
also gives less pressure on the bottom wraps, as each wrap adds to the
pressure. These reels are driven by means of plain jaw or friction clutches.</p>

<p>The wear of a flat rope is excessive and the rope itself costs more
than a round rope of the same strength, does not last as long, and
requires more care and attention.</p>

<p id="ART_22"><b>22. Calculating Size of Flat Rope and Reel.</b>&mdash;The calculation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
the size of a flat rope for given work is not so simple as that of a
round rope, as there is a variable factor in the width and thickness
of the rope that must be taken into account. To illustrate the method
of calculation, suppose that it is required to hoist 5,000 pounds of
material in a 3,000-pound skip from a vertical two-compartment shaft
2,000 feet deep under conditions requiring a factor of safety of about
9 for the rope.</p>

<p>The determination of the size of the rope and the small and large
diameters of the reels must proceed together. The latter calculations
are performed in much the same manner as for conical drums.</p>

<p>Referring to Table relating to flat wire ropes in <i>Hoisting</i>,
Part 2, it is found that a flat steel rope 6 inches by ½ inch in size and
with a breaking strength of 150,000 pounds weighs 5.1 pounds per foot;
hence, 2,000 feet of it weighs 2,000 × 5.1 = 10,200 pounds. The total
load on the rope will then be 19,000 pounds, made up as follows:</p>

<p>An 8" × ½" rope with a breaking strength of 200,000 pounds weighs 6.9
pounds per foot; hence, 2,000 feet of it weighs 2,000 × 6.9 = 13,800
pounds. The load on the rope will then be 22,600 pounds, made up as

<p><b>24. Koepe System.</b>&mdash;In its lightest form, a drum requires a
large amount of power to set it in motion, which power is absorbed by the
brake and lost when it is brought to rest again. Furthermore, with
deep shafts requiring long drums, the fleet, or angle that the rope
makes with the head-sheave due to its traveling from one end of the
drum to the other, is not only a disadvantage and possible cause of
accident, but it is a source of wear. To overcome these objections and
also the great cost of large cylindrical or conical drums, the <b>Koepe
system</b> of hoisting, shown in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>, was devised by Mr. Frederick
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
Koepe. A single grooved driving sheave <i>a</i> is used in place of a
drum. The winding rope <i>b</i> passes from one cage <i>A</i> up over
a head-sheave, thence around the sheave <i>a</i> and back over another
head-sheave, and down to a second cage <i>B</i>; it encircles a little
over half the periphery of the driving sheave and is driven by the
friction between the sheave and rope. A balance rope <i>c</i> beneath
the cages and passing around the sheave <i>d</i> gives an endless-rope
arrangement with the cages fixed at the proper points. The driving
sheave is stronger than an ordinary carrying sheave, as it has to do
the driving and is usually lined with hardwood, which is grooved to
receive the winding rope, the depth of the groove being generally equal
to twice the diameter of the rope. Instead of being placed parallel,
the head-sheaves are placed at an angle with each other, each pointing
to the groove in the driving sheave, thus reducing the side friction of
the rope on the sheaves.</p>

<p>The system has been in successful operation since 1877, and experiments
made on it have determined that, with a rope passing only one-half
turn around the drum sheave, the coefficient of adhesion with clean
ropes is about .3. If the ropes are oiled, the adhesion becomes
less, and sometimes slippage occurs, producing not only wear of the
driving sheave lining but giving an incorrect reading of the hoist
indicator and thus possibly producing overwinding, unless the position
of the cage is indicated by marks on the rope, or unless the engineer
can see the cage.</p>

<p>At the end of the hoist, if the upper cage is allowed to rest on the
keep, its weight and the weight of the tail-rope are taken from the
hoisting rope, and there is then not enough pull on the hoisting rope
to produce sufficient friction with the drum sheave to start the next
hoist. To prevent this trouble, the keeps are dispensed with, or the
rope is made continuous and independent of the cage. To do this,
crossheads are placed above and below each cage and connected by ropes
or chains outside of the cages. The bridle chains are then hung from
the top crosshead, and when the cage rests on the keeps, the weight of
the winding and tail-ropes remains on the driving sheaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><b>25. Advantages and Disadvantages of the Koepe System.</b>&mdash;With
this system, only one driving sheave is necessary for the operation of two
compartments, and it is light, inexpensive to build, and very narrow,
admitting of a short sheave shaft and small foundations. This system
permits a perfect balance of rope and cage, so that the work to be done
by the engine is uniform, except for the acceleration, and consists
only in lifting the material and overcoming the friction. There is no
fleeting of the rope between the driving sheaves and the head-sheaves.</p>

<p>The system has the following disadvantages, which prevent its being
used to any considerable extent: Liability to slippage of the rope
on the drum; if the rope breaks, both cages may fall to the bottom;
hoisting from different levels cannot be well done, for, since the
cages are at fixed distances from each other, the length of the rope is
such that when one cage <i>A</i> is at the top, the other cage <i>B</i>
is at the bottom. If hoisting is to be done from the bottom, this is
satisfactory, but if hoisting is to be done from some upper level, cage
<i>B</i>, which is at the bottom, must be hoisted to that level to be
loaded before it can go to the top. Then, when cage <i>B</i> goes to
the top with its load, cage <i>A</i> must go to the bottom, wait there
while cage <i>B</i> is being unloaded, and then be hoisted to the upper
level to receive its load. For each trip, therefore, the time required
for a cage to go from the bottom to the upper level and be loaded
is lost; and two movements of the engines are necessary for a hoist
instead of one.</p>

<p><b>26. The Whiting System.</b>&mdash;This is a system of hoisting with
round ropes, in which two rope wheels placed tandem are used in
place of cylindrical or conical drums. As shown in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a>,
for a two-compartment shaft the rope passes from one cage <i>a</i> up over
a head-sheave <i>c</i>, down under a guide sheave <i>d</i>, and is
then wound three times about the rope wheels <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, to
secure a good hold, then around a fleet sheave <i>g</i>, and back under
another guide sheave <i>h</i>, up over another head-sheave <i>i</i>,
and down to the other cage <i>b</i>. When the system is to be used
for a single-compartment shaft, one end of the rope carries the cage
and the other end carries a balance weight, which is run up and down
in a corner of the shaft. A balance rope below the cages, as shown,
is generally used, though it is not essential to the working of the
system, as it is in the Koepe system. When sinking a shaft, a balance rope
cannot be used as it interferes with the work at the bottom of the shaft.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_15" src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="406" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
The drums or wheels <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> are light, inexpensive, and
narrow, thus permitting short sheave shafts and small foundations.
They are lined with hardwood blocks, each lining having three rope
grooves turned in it. The main wheel <i>e</i> is driven by a hoisting
engine, which may be either first or second motion. The following
wheel <i>f</i> is coupled to the main wheel by a pair of parallel
rods, one on each side, like the drivers of a locomotive. As the rope
wraps about the wheels <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> three times, there are six
semi-circumferences of driving contact with the rope, as compared
with the one semi-circumference in the Koepe system, and there is no
slipping of the rope on the wheels. The following wheel <i>f</i> is
best tilted or inclined from the vertical an amount equal, in the
diameter of the wheels, to the pitch of the rope on the wheel, so that
the rope may not run out of its groove and may run straight from one
wheel to the other without any chafing between the ropes and the sides
of the grooves.</p>

<p>The capacity of the wheels <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> is unlimited, while
grooved cylindrical drums, conical drums, and reels will hold only the
fixed length of rope for which they are designed.</p>

<p>As shown by the dotted lines, the fleet sheave <i>g</i> is arranged to
travel backwards and forwards, in order to change the working length of
the rope from time to time to provide for an increased depth of shaft,
and for the changes in the length of rope due to stretching and when
the ends are cut off to resocket the rope. The fleet sheave <i>g</i> is
moved a distance equal to half the change in the length of rope.</p>

<p><b>27</b>. Hoisting from intermediate levels can be readily done with
the Whiting system; for instance, if the cage <i>a</i> is at the top
and cage <i>b</i> at the bottom, and hoisting is to be done from some
upper level, it is only necessary to run the fleet sheave <i>g</i> out,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
and thus shorten the working length of the rope until cage <i>b</i>
comes up to the upper level. It can then be loaded and go to the top.
While cage <i>b</i> goes to the top, cage <i>a</i> descends to the same
level, where it can be loaded while cage <i>b</i> is being unloaded,
and can then go directly to the top without any of the lost time, as is
the case in the Koepe system.</p>

<p>The system permits a perfect balance of rope and cage, so that the work
to be done by the engines is uniform, except for the acceleration, and
consists only in lifting the material and overcoming the friction.</p>

<p>There is no fleeting of the rope, so the rope wheels can be placed as
close to the shaft as may be desired.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> This system was tried as early as 1862 in Eastern
Pennsylvania, but it was not used extensively because hoisting from
great depths was not necessary, since, for depths of less than 1,000
feet, cylindrical and conical drums are quite satisfactory. In the
Lake Superior copper region, there are now three Whiting hoists, two
of which are probably the largest hoisting plants in the world. Each
plant consists of a pair of triple-expansion, vertical, inverted-beam
engines, driving direct a pair of 19-foot drums. The high-pressure
cylinders are 20 inches in diameter, the intermediate cylinders 32
inches, and the low-pressure cylinders 50 inches, and all six of them
have a 72-inch stroke. The rope used is a 2¼-inch plow-steel rope and
hoists 10 tons of material at a trip, in one case from a depth of 4,980
feet, the deepest shaft in the world. Several plants on the Whiting
system have been built in England, and two or more are working in South
Africa.</p>

<p><b>29. Modified Whiting System.</b>&mdash;A modification of the Whiting
system is sometimes used in which a large drum keyed to the crank-shaft
replaces the small tandem drums, and even the slight probability of
the rope slipping in the Whiting system is thus obviated. One rope is
fastened to one end of the drum, and the other rope to the other end in
such a way that while one is winding on the other will be winding off
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
the drum. One rope passes directly to the head-sheave while the other
passes first around a fleet sheave, similar to that used for the
Whiting system, but preferably placed horizontal, and thence to the
head-sheave. This system possesses the same advantages as the Whiting
system except that the depth of hoist is limited by the size of the
drum, and that there is a fleet of the rope. Up to the limiting depth,
as determined by the size of the drum, this system can be used with
equal economy for any depth. This hoist, as well as the Whiting, is
therefore especially suitable for a place where one mining company
operates several mines, for it enables the company to select one size
for all their permanent work, with all the advantages that come from
duplicate machinery.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> A common method of fastening a rope to a drum, <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16 (<i>a</i>)</a>,
is to pass the rope through a hole in the drum rim and then
around the shaft, clamping the end to the rope between the shaft and
shell, as shown. Care should be taken to make the radius of curvature
of the hole at <i>a</i> as large as possible so that the rope will not
be bent any sharper than is necessary. When an iron drum is used, the
thickness of the rim does not afford enough depth in which to bend the
rope and it is necessary to build in a pocket for the purpose, as shown
at <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16 (<i>b</i>)</a>. It is well to make both sides of
this pocket with a long radius to avoid damaging the rope in case all the rope
is accidentally unwound and the drum backed so as to bring the rope
against the other side of the pocket.

<p><b>31.</b> It is often desired to have the drum of a hoisting engine
run loosely on the engine shaft, so that it may run independently
of the engine. With such loose-running drums, the engine generally
runs only in the direction required to hoist the load, while the cage
is lowered entirely by means of the brake. In this way, one engine
provided with several drums may be used for hoisting from several
shafts or from several levels in the same shaft at the same time. Such
a loose-running drum is connected to the engine shaft when a load is to
be hoisted by means of a clutch, of which there are two forms commonly
used for hoisting machinery: <i>jaw</i> or <i>piston clutches</i> and
<i>friction clutches</i>.</p>

<p><b>32. Jaw Clutch.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a> shows a <b>jaw clutch</b>,
one-half <i>a</i> of which is shown ready to be bolted to a drum or flat rope
reel, which is loose on the shaft <i>b</i>. The other half <i>c</i> of
the clutch is moved back so that the jaws <i>d</i> are not in contact
with the jaws <i>e</i> on the part <i>a</i>. The half <i>c</i> slides
freely on a feather key <i>f</i>, which is driven tightly into a deep
key seat in the shaft <i>b</i>; a collar <i>g</i>, fitting loosely in
a groove in the hub of <i>c</i>, is provided with trunnions <i>h</i>
on each side; levers <i>i</i> connect these trunnions with the lever
<i>j</i> attached to a suitable handle, by means of which the clutch is
made to slide endwise on the shaft so that the jaws <i>d</i> engage
or disengage the jaws <i>e</i> and thus connect or disconnect the drum
or reel from the clutch. There are generally four or six jaws <i>d</i>
that engage the same number of jaws <i>e</i> on the drum, and it is
necessary to have little or no play between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
the clutch is connected or there will be too much shock. The clutch is
about 2 feet in diameter, and the jaws are 3 or 4 inches deep for the
average 20" × 48" first-motion hoisting engine. Instead of the clutch
being fastened to the shaft by feather keys, the shaft may be hexagonal
where the clutch slides on it and the clutch is machined to match. Jaw
clutches are made of either cast-iron or cast-steel, and should be in
halves, for convenience of repair, and securely bolted together.</p>

<p><b>33. Band Friction Clutches.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_18">Fig. 18</a> shows a
<b>band friction clutch</b> that is attached to and revolves with the shaft <i>a</i>.
The winding drum runs loosely on the same shaft and has a driving-band
ring or seat <i>b</i> on one end; when the ring <i>c</i> of the clutch
is tightened by means of the mechanism shown, the clutch and driving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
band become practically one piece and the drum revolves with the
clutch. The clutch is constructed as follows: The driving disk <i>d</i>
keyed to the driving shaft <i>a</i> is connected to one end of the ring
<i>c</i> by a fixed arm <i>e</i>, which is bolted firmly to the disk
<i>d</i> and revolves with it; a movable arm <i>f</i> that connects
with the other end of the band <i>c</i> turns on the pin <i>g</i>. When
the band <i>c</i> is loose, it can revolve about the seat <i>b</i>
without touching it, but the band can be tightened and made to clamp
<i>b</i> either when revolving or standing still, as follows: The
sliding sleeve <i>h</i> may be caused to slide about 6 inches along
the hub of the disk <i>d</i> by levers (not shown) that take hold of
trunnions <i>i</i> on a ring on the sliding sleeve; this sleeve is
connected to the movable arm <i>f</i> by a link <i>j</i>, and when the
sleeve is on the end of the hub the link stands at an angle of about
60° with the shaft; by sliding the sleeve toward the disk <i>d</i>,
the link is made to move the arm <i>f</i> about 1½ inches at its outer
end and to thus tighten the driving-band <i>c</i>, so that it grips
the ring <i>b</i>. The adjusting nuts <i>k</i> take up the wear of
the wooden blocks with which the ring <i>c</i> is lined. Band lifters
<i>l</i> hold the band clear of the ring when it is loose. The clutch
shown is built to run in the direction indicated by the arrow, but such
clutches may be built to run in either direction; they should always be
run in the direction for which they are designed, so that the load may
always come on the fixed arm. If the band be tightened slowly, there
will be no sudden start or jerk on the rope, as the slip of the band
will prevent the entire force of the grip taking effect at once; and
after the drum reaches full speed, there is little or no slipping of
the driving-band. It is best to keep the band only just tight enough to
do the work, for should the car get off the track, or be overwound, or
should a cage stick in the shaft for any reason, the band will slip and
thus become a safety appliance, and not strain or break the rope, shaft
timbering, or machinery, as would be the case if a positive clutch,
<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, were used.</p>

<p><b>34. The Beekman Friction Clutch.</b>&mdash;A simple friction clutch is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
shown in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>, in which <i>a</i> is a section of the drum
shell. The wooden blocks <i>b</i> bolted to the side of the gear-wheel <i>c</i>
are made of suitable shape to conform to the <b>V</b>-shaped groove
<i>d</i> in the side of the drum. The steel spring <i>e</i> between the
two steel washers <i>f</i>, <i>f</i> disengages the clutch, as soon as
the pressure is relieved, by reversing the motion of the lever <i>g</i>
and screw <i>h</i> from the opposite end of the drum. When the lever
<i>g</i> is turned, the screw <i>h</i> is forced against the end of the
pin <i>i</i>, which, in turn, presses the cross-key <i>j</i> against
the collar <i>k</i>, forcing the drum against the blocks <i>b</i> and
frictionally engaging the gear-wheel <i>c</i>. This drum shaft is
prevented from moving endwise by means of the collar <i>l</i> and the
grooves <i>m</i> in the babbitted pillow-block. The wide bearings of
the drum on its shaft are lubricated by means of the pipes <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>A clutch is often used to change the length of the hoisting rope when
hoisting from two or more lifts or levels. In this case the shaft
carries two drums, one of which is fixed to the shaft, while the other
is provided with a friction clutch. When it is desired to change the
length of the rope, the cage attached to the loose drum is brought
to, say, the upper landing. The cages both resting on the wings, the
clutch is loosened and the other cage attached to the fixed drum is now
brought to the desired level, when the clutch is again tightened and
hoisting proceeds. The change is made in 2 or 3 minutes.

<h3 id="BRAKE">BRAKES</h3>

<p><b>35</b>. A <b>brake</b> is a device by means of which the motion of
a hoisting drum may be retarded or stopped. This is accomplished by
friction of the brake against the circumference of the brake wheel.
There are three types of brakes, known as <i>block brakes</i>, <i>post
brakes</i>, and <i>strap brakes</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_20" src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="416" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>36. The Block Brake.</b>&mdash;The <b>block brake</b>,
<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>, consists of one or more wooden blocks or
shoes <i>b</i> attached to a lever having a fulcrum at <i>d</i>, and
connected by a rod to the lever <i>c</i>. Block brakes are objected
to mainly because they throw a great load on the journals of the drum
when they are applied; they cannot be relied on when there is a heavy
load on the drum, and they require the application of great force to
the lever <i>c</i> for a given braking power. They are, however, cheap
and easily applied to a drum, and the shoe is readily replaced when worn.</p>

<p><b>37. The Post Brake.</b>&mdash;The <b>post brake</b>, <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>,
is composed practically of two block brakes applied at two places on the drum
diametrically opposite each other, thus equalizing the pressure on the
journals. The blocks are generally somewhat longer than in the block
brake, or about one-quarter of the circumference of the drum on each
side. In <a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>, <i>a</i> is the drum; <i>b</i> are wooden
brake blocks; <i>c</i> are the posts which in the brake shown are of massive,
built-up, steel construction; <i>d</i> are the fulcrums on the plates
<i>e</i>, which plates are adjustable by means of the nuts <i>f</i>; by
means of these nuts, the fulcrums may be brought closer together as the
wooden blocks <i>b</i> wear away; <i>g</i> is a tension rod generally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
furnished with a turnbuckle to adjust its length as the wooden blocks
wear away. Power is applied at the end of the bent lever <i>h</i>, as
shown by the arrow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_21" src="images/i_033a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="283" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21</span></p>
</div>

<p>The stops <i>i</i> are adjusted so that the blocks <i>b</i> on each
side are equally distant from the drum when the brake is off. The
fulcrums <i>d</i> should be some distance below the drum and brake
ring, for if they are too near the drum it will be difficult to swing
the lower end of the wooden blocks far enough to clear the drum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_22" src="images/i_033b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="348" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>38. Improved Post Brake.</b>&mdash;In order to have an equal clearance at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
top and bottom, and to have a more powerful leverage than in the
ordinary post brake, the posts may be made movable at both top and
bottom, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>. The tops of the posts <i>a a′</i> are moved, as in
<a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>, by the tension rod <i>b</i> and the lever <i>c</i>, the latter
being connected by rod <i>d</i> to lever <i>e</i>. This lever is
pivoted at <i>f</i> and motion is transmitted to the fulcrums <i>j</i>
by the link <i>g</i>, the lever <i>h</i>, and the tension rod <i>i</i>.
The back post <i>a</i> is supported by the uprights <i>k</i>, which are
pivoted at <i>l</i> and swing backwards and forwards like a parallel
ruler. The front post <i>a′</i> is supported by the single upright
<i>m</i>, pivoted at <i>n</i>. The setscrews <i>o</i> regulate the
motion of the bottom of the posts so as to give equal clearance to the
bottom and top of the posts.</p>

<p>An objection to both the block and the post brake is the fact that, if
the drum surface to which the brake is applied is not perfectly round,
the resistance of the brake will not be uniform when applied while the
drum is in motion.</p>

<p><b>39. The Strap Brake.</b>&mdash;A <b>strap brake</b> consists of a
wrought-iron band or strap that partly encircles the drum and is
connected at its free ends to levers with which the band may be
tightened on the brake wheel and the drum thus firmly held. The iron
or steel band either lies directly against the wooden lagging of the
drum or on wooden blocks bolted to the drum; or else it has bolted to
it a lining of wooden blocks that bear on the drum when the band is
tightened.</p>

<p>The most efficient forms of strap brakes are those in which the strap
or straps are in contact with 270° or more of the circumference of the
drum. The greater the arc of contact, the more securely is the drum
held by the brake. A single strap is sometimes used, but this is only
satisfactory with small drums, say 8 feet or less in diameter; on large
drums two straps are generally used, each extending half way around
the drum. The levers for transmitting the power from the hand lever or
treadle to the brake strap are variously arranged. In some cases, the
force is multiplied by several short levers; in others, by one long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
lever. The treadle or foot-lever, however, has been replaced almost
entirely by the hand lever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_23" src="images/i_035a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="245" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>40.</b> The simplest form of strap brake, <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>,
consists of a single strap <i>a</i>, with one end anchored at <i>b</i> and the
free end attached to the brake lever <i>c</i>. This brake acts on the same
principle as the block brake and is open to the objection that it
brings an undue load on the journals, but it is more efficient and
holds the drum more firmly under a heavy load than a block brake.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_24" src="images/i_035b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="379" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24</span></p>
</div>

<p>Block brakes are usually run dry, but in band brakes and post brakes
with ample surfaces and proper leverage the wood may be occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
slightly oiled with black oil, which greatly adds to the durability of
the blocks without unduly lessening the power of the brake.</p>

<p><b>41.</b> A two-strap brake is shown in <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>. One end
of each strap <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> is fastened to the pedestal <i>c</i> by either of
the methods shown in <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24 (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>)</a>.
In the method shown in <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)</a>, the forgings
<i>d</i>, <i>d′</i>, drawn out to the form of bolts, are riveted to
the ends of the straps and passed through a casting <i>c</i> that is
secured to the foundation. The object in giving one bolt to one strap
and two bolts to the other strap is to allow the straps to pass each
other and yet have their lines of action intersect. The bolts are
fastened to <i>c</i> by four nuts on each bolt, i. e., two principal
nuts and two locknuts. This gives a means of adjustment in the length
of the strap to take up the wear.</p>

<p>A second method of securing or anchoring the back ends of the straps
is shown at (<i>c</i>). In this case, a wrought-iron angular piece
is riveted to each strap, and these pieces are passed over the bolt
<i>e</i> that takes the place of the casting of the former arrangement.
Nuts are used, as shown, to adjust the straps for wear. The bolt should
be short and stiff, so as to be well able to stand up to its work when
the drum is moving or tending to move in the direction shown by the arrow.</p>

<p>When the brake is applied, the friction between the brake strap and
the circumference of the brake wheel produces a great strain on the
pedestal <i>c</i>, which must be securely anchored.</p>

<p>The front ends of the straps are worked into eyes, as shown at
<i>f</i>, and by these eyes and suitable pins passing through them the
ends are fastened to the brake lever <i>g</i>. This lever is supported
on and rotates about a pin <i>h</i>, so that when the braking force is
applied at <i>i</i>, in the direction of the arrow, the brake lever
rotates, pulling down on strap <i>a</i> and up on strap <i>b</i>; and,
if the straps are held firmly at the back end, the more force that is
applied at <i>i</i> the tighter will the drum be gripped by <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The ends of the straps should be brought in as close to the drum as is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
practicable, both front and back, so as to give the greatest amount of
contact between the drum and the straps and to get the best effect from
the force applied. The springs <i>j</i> are used with straps that are
not stiff enough to clear the drum when the brake is released.</p>

<p><b>42.</b> The rotation of the drum may assist or retard the action of
the lever in applying the drop brake. For instance, if, in <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>,
the drum revolves in the direction indicated by the arrow, the pull
of the drum at the brake strap is in the same direction as the pull
of the lever when applying the brake and the action of the lever is
then assisted by the motion of the drum. On the other hand, if the
drum is revolving in the opposite direction, it opposes the action of
the lever and a greater force must be applied to the lever to overcome
this opposing pull of the drum. Hence, in the case of strap brakes, if
possible, that end should be anchored which will cause the revolution
of the drum to assist the lever in applying the brake and throw the
strain on the anchor bolt instead of on the lever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_25" src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="369" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>43.</b> If a brake is required to work with the drum running in
either direction, there are several ways of bringing the strain due
to the load on the anchorage in whichever way the drum runs. One of
the simplest of these is shown in <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>, where <i>a</i> is
a drum with a strap brake <i>b</i> embracing nearly the entire circumference;
<i>c</i> is a lever bar that is attached to the ends of the brake strap
by pins <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, which work in the slots <i>f</i> in the
iron anchor plates <i>g</i>. One anchor plate is on each side of the
lever, and both are bolted to the foundation. If the band is kept of
the proper length, then, no matter which way the drum is turning, the
pull of the drum will come on the anchorage, and the pull on the lever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
need be only sufficient to take up the slack end of the band. To
illustrate: If the drum is turning in the direction indicated by the
arrow, the pin <i>e</i> holding the lower end of the band will be on
the bottom of its slot and the pin <i>d</i> will be free in its slot
and engaged in tightening the slack end of the band through the motion
of the lever <i>c</i>. Were the drum running the other way, the pin
<i>d</i> connected with the upper half of the band would move to the
upper end of its slot and take the main load, while the pin <i>e</i>
at the lower end of the band would only have to take up the slack.
The outer, or long, end of the lever moves downwards in all cases to
tighten the band. Provision must be made to lift the band clear of the
drum when slack, but no anchorage other than at <i>g</i> should be
attempted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_26" src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="243" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>44. The Differential Brake.</b>&mdash;The differential brake has both
ends of the brake strap attached to short lever arms operated by
the brake lever, but these arms are of different lengths and are so
arranged that as the longer arm tightens the brake strap the shorter
arm yields and loosens the strap. The tightening, however, is more than
the loosening or yielding and, as a result, the brake band is tightened
about the brake wheel. The form of the lever arm is immaterial so long
as the differential principle is retained, that is, that the shorter
arm yields when the longer pulls, when the brake is thrown into action.
This principle is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>. In this brake,
no provision is made for anchoring either end of the brake strap, but the entire
load is thrown on the lever arms <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. These lever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
arms are connected with the arm <i>c</i>, which revolves on the
same shaft <i>d</i> and is operated by the reach rod <i>e</i>. The
revolution of the drum is thus resisted by the shaft <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>This brake is self-acting when the drum revolves so as to pull on the
shorter arm, as indicated by the arrows; that is, the motion of the
drum helps to set the brake when the latter is once applied. When,
however, the drum revolves in the opposite direction, the action of
the brake is opposed, instead of being assisted, by the motion of the
drum. As a consequence, this particular form of brake is not adapted to
hoisting drums that revolve in opposite directions at each alternate
hoist. Differential brakes are not generally used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_27" src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="258" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>45. Power for Brakes.</b>&mdash;For small drums and light loads, the
brakes are usually applied by hand power through suitable lever
connections. The force that a man can exert can be multiplied
indefinitely by levers and combinations of levers; but while the force
is multiplied, the distance through which it can act is divided in the
same ratio. A certain amount of motion is required to free the brake
band from the drum, when the brake is off; this, then, limits the
leverage that a man can use. Suppose, for instance, that with a strap
brake the band moves from the drum ½ inch, thus increasing the diameter
1 inch, or the circumference about 3 inches. Then, supposing that a
man can exert his force to advantage through 3 feet, or 36 inches, the
available leverage is ³⁶/₃ = 12. That is, if a man can pull 50 pounds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
on his hand lever, he can exert 50 × 12 = 600 pounds circumferentially
on the brake band, with simple levers. If any form of differential
levers is used, the ratio by which the force applied at the hand lever
can be increased will be considerably larger. A diagram will explain
this more clearly.</p>

<p><b>46.</b> In <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>, <i>a</i> is the hand lever, with a fulcrum

bands. If the leverage of the hand lever <i>a</i> is made 6 to 1, that

<p class="no-indent">a pull of 300 pounds × 4 = 1,200 pounds will
be exerted at the pin <i>f</i> or <i>g</i>. This total pull must be
divided equally between the arms <i>eg</i> and <i>ef</i>, giving 600
pounds pull on each. According to the principle of the lever, the
distances through which these forces act are inversely proportional
to the forces acting. It is assumed that the brakeman can exert the
force of 50 pounds through 36 inches; if this is the motion of the end
of the hand lever <i>a</i>, one-sixth of this, or 6 inches, will be
the motion at <i>c</i> and, therefore, at <i>h</i>; one-fourth of 6
inches or 1½ inches will be the motion at <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>; that
is, <i>f</i> will increase its half of the brake band 1½ inches in
circumference, and <i>g</i> will do likewise with its half, making the
total circumference 3 inches more, or the diameter 1 inch more, and
thereby moving the band away from the drum ½ inch radially. The levers
are all shown in mid-position to make the figure more simple, but the
relative leverages remain the same at all points in the motion.</p>

<p>This is an example of simple levers, but the force applied at the hand
lever may be increased in a much greater ratio by the use of a device
known as a <i>differential lever</i>.

<p>From the principle just given, it is plain that, if <i>p o</i>, <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>,
represents a brake lever with the reach rod attached at <i>q</i>,
a smaller pull will be exerted on the brake band if the lever is moved
to the position <i>b o</i> than would be exerted if a lever were moved
through the same angle from <i>b o</i> to <i>d o</i>. The movement
from <i>p o</i> to <i>b o</i> is a convenient and easy one for the
engineer to make, while the movement from <i>b o</i> to <i>d o</i> is
inconvenient. To overcome the inconvenience and still to obtain the
advantage of this latter movement, the differential lever shown in
<a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a> is used. By means of an arm placed on the lever,
the point of attaching the reach rod is at <i>l</i> instead of <i>p</i>; hence,
when the handle <i>r b</i> is moved to the position <i>s b</i>, the
point <i>l</i> moves to <i>m</i>, thus securing a greater and gradually
increasing pull with the easier movement of the handle.</p>

<p>A differential lever may be advantageously used in connection with any
band or post brake and on a drum running in either direction. Such
levers are considered by many preferable to the differential brake.</p>

<p><b>48. Power Brakes.</b>&mdash;Large drums and heavily loaded drums
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
cannot be controlled by hand-power brakes, and in such a case some other
form of power, such as steam, compressed air, or water, must be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_30" src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="244" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30</span></p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a> shows, in outline, how such power is applied.
The movements of the hand lever <i>A</i>, instead of being directly
communicated to the lever operating the brake, merely control the
valve <i>v</i> connected with the cylinder <i>a</i>. By means of this
valve, steam, compressed air, or water is admitted to either end of
the cylinder and this moves the piston in the direction necessary to
apply or release the brake. There are a number of varieties of such
power brakes, differing in structural details, but the action of all
is essentially the same. With steam or air power, the brake would be
applied with its full force almost instantaneously, thus subjecting
the various parts of the mechanism to very severe and objectionable
strains, unless the valves were modified so as to regulate the
admission of the steam or air. One method of controlling this action
is the use of a valve that requires a long travel to give it a full
opening. Such a valve can be opened a little, so as to allow the steam
to leak through and thereby increase the pressure in the cylinder
gradually. As the motion is difficult to regulate, a better method is
by means of a floating valve, described in <i>Hoisting</i>, Part 1.</p>

<p><b>49. Crank Brake.</b>&mdash;In addition to the brake applied to the
drum and intended for use mainly in emergencies, many hoisting engines
are also fitted with a strap brake applied to the crank-disk. In some
states, crank-brakes are required by law. In order to give a large
bearing surface, the crank-disk is made very large.

</div>

<h3 id="SHEAVE">SHEAVES</h3>

<p><b>1. Sheaves</b> are grooved iron or steel wheels used to
carry or guide a rope. The general method of mounting them on a frame
for hoisting light loads is shown in <a href="#FIG_1A">Fig. 1</a>. The journal
boxes are so constructed as to be easily taken apart for inspection or repair.
For hoisting heavy loads, the timbers must be braced, as is explained
under the heading Head-Frames in this Section. Sheaves are of two
styles&mdash;those composed entirely of cast-iron and those with cast-iron
hubs and rims and wrought-iron or soft-steel arms or spokes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_1A" src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="530" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>2.</b> The <b>cast-iron sheave</b>, <a href="#FIG_2A">Fig. 2</a>, has arms
with a cross-section, as shown at <i>a b</i>, and with the flanges of the arms
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2A"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
tapering from the hub to the rim; that is, <i>d</i> is greater than
<i>c</i> and <i>f</i> is greater than <i>e</i>. The bottom of the
groove <i>g</i> in the rim should be a circular arc, whose radius is a
little larger than that of the rope used over the sheave, to allow for
the angling of the rope due to its fleeting on the drum. The flanges
<i>h</i> are made quite deep to prevent the rope jumping off.</p>

<p>This sheave is cheaper than a combined cast-iron and wrought-iron or
steel sheave, and for many purposes it is entirely satisfactory. Its
great weight is an objection, because it adds to the weight on the
journals and also offers considerable resistance to being set in motion
and stopped.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_2A" src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="452" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></p>
</div>

<p>If a sheave is merely used to carry the rope or to deflect it only a
little, the contact and pressure between the rope and the sheave is
small; consequently, the power of the rope to turn the sheave will be
slight. In such a case, when the rope starts or stops quickly, as it
usually does in modern hoisting plants, the heavier the sheave the more
will it lag behind the rope and the greater will be the wear on the
rope due to slipping.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The sheave with a cast-iron hub and rim and wrought-iron or
soft-steel spokes, <a href="#FIG_3A">Fig. 3</a>, is an excellent and extensively
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3A"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
used sheave, especially the larger diameters. The spokes are screwed
into the hub and rim and are carried to the right and to the left of
the hub alternately, as shown in <a href="#FIG_3A">Fig. 3 (<i>b</i>)</a>, so as to
take hold of the opposite ends of the hub, thereby giving stiffness to the sheave
against any side stress.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_3A" src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p>
</div>

<p>With a sheave having cast-iron arms, the load from the rope is
transmitted to the shaft by a compressive stress through the arms
directly under the load; that is, if a rope runs over the sheave,
<a href="#FIG_2A">Fig. 2</a>, putting a load on it from <i>j</i> to <i>k</i>,
this load will be transmitted as a compressive stress through the arms <i>l</i>
and <i>m</i> to the hub and the shaft. Of course, a part of this load
is carried around the rim to the lower arms and is supported by them
in tension, but these lower arms are not considered in designing the
sheave because cast-iron is of comparatively little value in tension,
whereas it is of great value in compression. In the case of the sheave
with wrought-iron arms, or spokes, <a href="#FIG_3A">Fig. 3</a>, the load is
transmitted around the rim to the side opposite its point of application and is
carried from there to the hub and shaft by the tension of the spokes;
in fact, from the method of construction, the spokes in this sheave act
only by tension. The sheave is strong and rigid, and much lighter than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4A"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
a cast-iron sheave of the same strength, so that there is less wear
between it and the rope due to any slipping action when it is started
or stopped.</p>

  <div class="figsub">
   <img id="FIG_4A" src="images/i_104a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />

   </div>
</div>

<p><b>4.</b> Sometimes, the spokes, instead of being radial as in <a href="#FIG_3A">Fig. 3</a>,
are made tangent at the center of the wheel, <a href="#FIG_4A">Fig. 4</a>, to an imaginary
circle, which is about 2 inches in diameter for a 10-foot sheave.
Alternate pairs of spokes are made tangent to the opposite sides of
the circle, so that they pull against each other, and this makes the
sheave rigid in both directions. That is, spoke <i>A</i> is tangent to
the right side of the tangent circle and <i>A′</i> to the left side,
while spoke <i>B</i> is tangent to the right side of the circle and
<i>B′</i> to the left side. The pair <i>B B′</i> is joined to one end
of the hub, while the pair <i>A A′</i> is joined to the other end, thus
giving lateral stiffness to the sheave. This arranges the spokes in
groups of four, so that the total number must be some multiple of four.
The tangential direction of the spokes is often necessary in very large
sheaves carrying heavy loads, because with such a sheave it requires
considerable force to turn the shaft in its bearings, and while radial
spokes act only as long levers in turning the shaft, with tangential
spokes there is also a direct pull to do it.</p>

<p><b>5. Wood-Lined Sheaves.</b>&mdash;The rims of all sheaves are made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5A"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
either solid or with wooden lining, as shown in section in <a href="#FIG_5A">Fig. 5</a>.
One flange <i>a</i> of the rim is a separate piece that is held on by
bolts <i>b</i>. The wooden lining is in the form of blocks placed with
the grain of the wood running radially and held securely by clamping
together the two flanges with bolts, as shown. With such a sheave,
there is much less wear on the rope than there is with one that has a
plain cast-iron rim. The wear of the sheave proper is also avoided,
because as the blocks wear down they are taken out and replaced by new
ones.</p>

<p><b>6. Diameter of Sheave.</b>&mdash;The size of a sheave about which
a rope bends is determined generally by the size of the rope to be
used, as explained under Wire Ropes in <i>Hoisting</i>, Part 2; but,
if the rope is simply to be supported in a straight line, the space
available for setting the sheave and its cost and weight usually
determine the size used. The minimum allowable diameter of sheave
should not be used unless it is necessary to do so, for the larger the
sheave the less will be the wear of the rope due to the bending, and
the longer the life of the rope, but the cost of the sheave, which
increases with the size, puts a limit in the other direction.</p>

<p><b>7. Rollers and Carrying Sheaves.</b>&mdash;Wooden or iron
rollers are sometimes used for rope carriers or guides, instead of
light sheaves, when the rope has merely to be supported and there
is no bending of the rope, excepting the slight amount due to the
sagging between the rollers. The diameter of the rollers is of little
importance in such cases so far as the rope is concerned. If they
are for use on a slope to keep the rope from dragging on the ground,
they must be small, because the cars must run over them, and mine
cars are usually made low because of restricted headroom in the mine.
Rollers and carrying sheaves are fully described and illustrated in
<i>Haulage</i>.</p>

<p>If a hoisting rope changes its course from a straight line, even if
the deflection is only a small amount, a roller is not advisable and a
sheave should be used, if possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6A"></a>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p class="f150 space-above2"><b>CAGES</b></p>

<h3 id="VERT_CAGE">CAGES FOR VERTICAL SHAFTS</h3>

<p><b>8.</b> A <b>cage</b> is a carriage used for hoisting mine cars
and their contents, men, timber, etc., in both vertical and inclined
shafts. Cages are built of wood strengthened with iron or steel, or
entirely of iron or steel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_6A" src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="585" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>9.</b> The cage shown in <a href="#FIG_6A">Fig. 6</a> is much used in the
anthracite region of Pennsylvania. It is made largely of oak strengthened with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7A"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
iron and the size varies to suit the shaft, being sometimes as large as
6 feet wide by 12 feet long. The general construction of the cage is
evident from the figure, but several appliances that should be common
to all cages in some form or other require detailed explanation.</p>

<p>A covering <i>a</i>, called a <b>bonnet</b>, protects persons on the
cage from objects falling down the shaft, and is required by law in
some States. This bonnet is made of steel plate with flanges or angle
irons to stiffen it, and is usually inclined. To prevent objects of
moderate size from wedging between the edge of the bonnet and the shaft
lining, the former is sometimes made shorter than the cage, so that
a space of about a foot is left between its lower edge and the shaft
lining. A short bonnet of this character does not, however, fully
protect persons on the cage. The upper part of the bonnet is fastened
to the upper cross-bar of the cage by two hinges and is held up by rods
<i>b</i> that are attached to the bonnet and have sockets at their
lower ends, which fit over pins bolted to the uprights of the cage. By
raising the rods from the pins the bonnet can be lowered so that pipes
or long timbers may be lowered on the cage.</p>

<p><b>10. Safety catches</b> are intended to prevent a cage falling
in case the hoisting rope breaks. A common form, shown at <i>c</i>,
<a href="#FIG_6A">Fig. 6</a>, and in detail in <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7</a>,
consists of a pair of toothed cams <i>j</i>, <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7</a>,
fastened on each side of the cage near the shaft
guides. The drawbar <i>b</i> to which the rope is attached extends
through the top cross-piece of the cage and through the cylinder
<i>d</i>, at the bottom of which is a plate <i>c</i> supplied with
lugs for the rods <i>f</i> that connect it with the levers <i>g</i>.
Inside the cylinder are three powerful rubber springs, which are in
compression so long as the cage hangs from the rope, but are extended
if the rope breaks, drawing the rods <i>f</i> down and with them the
ends of the levers <i>g</i> to which they are attached; and, since the
levers are pivoted, their other ends are moved upwards and with them
the rods <i>k</i>. The cams <i>j</i> are each attached to one end of
the rods <i>k</i> in such a manner that as the rods move upwards they
rotate the cams inwards until they come in contact with the shaft
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8A"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
guides. The teeth of the cams grasp the wooden shaft guides and stop
the descent of the cage. The cams are provided with projections
<i>a</i> and <i>l</i> that strike the guide and thus prevent the cams
turning entirely around. <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7 (<i>a</i>)</a> shows the springs
extended and the dogs <i>j</i> just about to grasp the shaft guides, while
<a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7 (<i>c</i>)</a> shows the position of the dogs when
the springs are compressed as they are when hoisting. At <i>e</i> in cylinder
<i>d</i>, <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7 (<i>b</i>)</a>, there are slots for the
lugs of plate <i>c</i> to move up and down as the spring is compressed
or extended. Instead of rubber springs, helical steel springs are
sometimes used, and with a somewhat different design flat steel springs
are used.</p>

</div>

<p>The cams, or dogs, may be placed at any point along the upright post
of the cage, and in some cases two sets of cams are used on each side,
one set at the top and another in the middle, both sets being connected
by rods so that they work together. Practical tests of these catches,
made by allowing the cage to drop, show that they are, as a rule,
very efficient devices. The cams usually take hold at once, the cage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9A"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
dropping only a few inches, or, at most, a few feet if the guides are
dry and free from oil. When the guides are very greasy or wet, the cage
may drop several feet before the cams take a firm hold and stop it, and
with ice-covered guides, instances are given where the cage has fallen
15 feet before the cams ploughed their way through the ice and took firm
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10A"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
hold of the guides; but in so doing the momentum the cage acquired was
so great that the guides were destroyed. Fortunately for the utility of
safety catches, ropes are usually broken while a loaded cage is being
raised, and the cage has an upward momentum; if a rope breaks when the
cage is descending at a speed of 30 or 40 feet a second, its momentum
is so great that either the catches or guides break. The catches
generally hold and either the guides or cage suffer more or less injury
under such circumstances. Instead of being placed near the top of
the cage the dogs are frequently placed near the center, or near the
bottom; in some cases two sets of dogs have been used, one set being at
the top and the other at the bottom. Instead of being cam-shaped with
a number of small teeth on the rim of the cam, as shown in <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7</a>,
the dogs are now frequently made consisting of one or more strong straight
teeth on each side of the guide. These teeth are operated similarly
to those shown in <a href="#FIG_7A">Fig. 7</a>, and are driven into the
guides if the rope breaks, thus holding the cage more firmly than the
cam-shaped guides, particularly where the guides are wet.</p>

<p><b>11. The Heavy Steel Cage.</b>&mdash;The cage that is shown in <a href="#FIG_8A">Fig. 8</a>
is made of iron and steel except the wood flooring, which is laid in
two courses, one lengthwise and one diagonal. The joints should not be
driven too tightly, as the wood is likely to swell. The track is bolted
to the floor, or <b>deck</b>, of the cage. The cast-steel safety dogs
are operated by steel springs <i>a</i>, coiled about the bars <i>b</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11A"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
which are connected to the drawbar <i>c</i> by chains, as shown. The
drawbar drops if the rope breaks and thus assists the action of the
springs <i>a</i>. This cage is in use at both coal and iron mines, and
is built to suit any size of shaft and guides. Standard sizes are given
in <a href="#TABLE_I">Table I</a>.</p>

<p><b>12. The Light Steel Cage.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_9A">Fig. 9</a> shows a
light steel cage much used at gold and silver mines. It has a spring drawbar and
steel safety dogs, operated by steel springs, as in <a href="#FIG_8A">Fig. 8</a>,
but the floor is of steel grating in order to give as little air
pressure as possible against the cage. The openings <i>a</i> in the
side frames are provided so that through them the nuts can be tightened
on the bolts that hold the shaft guides. The cage is provided with
bails <i>b</i> that swing down over each end of a car to hold it on the
cage.</p>

<p><b>13. Multiple-Deck Cages.</b>&mdash;Cages are sometimes built that
have two or more decks or platforms one above the other, thus giving
greater hoisting capacity to a shaft. A two-deck, safety, hoisting cage
is shown in <a href="#FIG_10A">Fig. 10</a>. The upper deck is heavier than in a
single-deck cage of similar construction. The lower deck is suspended from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12A"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
upper deck by means of pins so that it may be removed at any time. A
double-deck cage may be used by first changing the car on the upper
deck and then bringing the lower deck to the track level and changing
the other car. Time can be saved by having two track levels, both at
the loading and landing stations, enabling both decks to be loaded and
unloaded at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Multiple-deck cages</b> have been mainly used at ore mines in

<h3 id="AUTO_CAGE" class="space-above2">AUTOMATIC DUMPING CAGES</h3>

<p><b>14.</b> A <b>dumping cage</b> is a cage so constructed that at the
proper place it can be automatically tipped sufficiently to dump the
contents of a car that is on it and will then right itself for the down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13A"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
trip, thus avoiding the necessity of removing the car from the cage,
and saving time at the head. The construction of the cage is such
that the car is held firmly in place while dumping. The principle of
the self-dumping cage is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_11A">Fig. 11</a>, the cage
being shown in its highest and lowest positions. The cage is made in two parts
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The fixed frames <i>b</i> slide on the guides
<i>k</i> and have attached to them the safety catches and hoisting
gear. The movable part <i>a</i> is united to the frame <i>b</i> by
the hinge <i>c</i>. The platform <i>d</i>, on which the car rests,
is fastened to the movable part <i>a</i> by the support <i>e</i>
and further secured by the braces <i>f</i>. At the top of <i>a</i>
is attached the wheel <i>g</i> that runs along the rail <i>h</i>,
keeping <i>a</i> in an upright position until it reaches the dumping
place <i>i</i>. Here the rail <i>h</i> is bent as shown and the wheel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14A"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
<i>g</i> is made to follow it by means of the guide <i>j</i>. This
throws the top of <i>a</i> over so as to incline the platform and
dump the car that is on it. On lowering, the cage rights itself when
<i>g</i> passes below the point <i>i</i>. The part <i>b</i> is kept in
a vertical position by means of shoes that slide on the main guides <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>It is possible to dispense with the guide rail <i>h</i> by attaching a
flange to the top of <i>a</i> at the back, to slide on the main guide
<i>k</i>. This flange should be shorter than the shoe on <i>b</i>. The
main guide is cut away at the point where this flange comes when the
wheel <i>g</i> enters the curved guide <i>j</i>, leaving an opening
just large enough to allow the flange on <i>a</i> to pass through. The
shoe on <i>b</i>, being longer, completely spans the space and cannot
pass through, but makes <i>b</i> move straight up on the main guides.</p>

<p>The bottom of the cage in <a href="#FIG_11A">Fig. 11</a> has an interrupted track,
and at the bottom of the shaft the track is also interrupted, as shown in the
plan at the bottom of the figure, but in such a way that when the cage
is resting at the bottom this portion of the track <i>n</i> projects
up through the bottom of the cage and makes a continuous track. When
the cage is raised the wheels of the car drop into the spaces <i>n</i>
in the cage bottom, thus preventing the car from running off the cage
during hoisting or dumping.</p>

<p><b>15. Slope, or Inclined-Shaft, Hoisting.</b>&mdash;In a slope, or
inclined shaft, the mine cars are attached directly to the hoisting
rope and hoisted singly or in trains for inclinations less than 35°,
at which inclination the material will begin to fall from the top of
the car. For steeper slopes, it is customary to use a slope cage or
carriage on which the mine car is hoisted, or else to dump one or
more cars of the material into a gunboat, or skip, at the bottom of
the slope or at some landing along the slope, and to then hoist the
gunboat, or skip.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_12A">Fig. 12</a> shows a cage for use in a slope or steeply inclined
shaft. It is made of steel with timber platform and differs from a vertical shaft
cage mainly in having its upper frame inclined and in running on four
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15A"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
wheels <i>a, b</i>. These wheels usually run on timber guides, so that
the safety dogs <i>c</i> will take hold of the guide in case the rope
breaks. For slopes of variable inclination, the platform <i>d</i> may
be made adjustable by means of a hand lever so as to be always level.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_12A" src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="536" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>16.</b> A <b>slope carriage</b> is a frame so constructed that when
rails are placed on the top and a mine car run on them the car will be
practically horizontal. The carriage is mounted on wheels and axles in
order to follow the slope tracks, and is supplied with a drawbar, or
with hooks, as shown in <a href="#FIG_13A">Fig. 13</a>, for attachment
to the hoisting rope.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16A"></a>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>These carriages are sometimes built to run on a slope track of the same
gauge as the mine cars, but to insure stability they have generally a
broader gauge. The headroom necessary is governed not so much by the
form of the carriage as by the length of the car and the inclination
of the seam. This height is less when the cars are placed on the
carriage with their length across the slope than when they are run on
lengthwise; but this arrangement increases the width of the slope. When
the inclination is very steep, the wheels are sometimes placed on the
sides of the carriage and above its center of gravity and run between
two tracks or guides, on each side of the slope.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_13A" src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="442" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13</span></p>
</div>

<p>The carriage, <a href="#FIG_13A">Fig. 13</a>, is for use on slopes of a uniform
inclination. It is made almost entirely of heavy timber, is stiff and simple of
construction, and is easy to repair. Its details will be readily
understood from the illustrations, except perhaps, the device for
locking the car to prevent its running off during the hoist. The middle
portion of the platform <i>a</i> having a piece of the car track on it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17A"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
may move vertically up or down. As shown in the side elevation, it
is resting on the horizontal timbers <i>b</i> of the carriage in a
position ready for hoisting. At the end of the hoist, when the cage
settles on the keeps <i>c</i>, shown in the end elevation, this
platform reaches them first and is supported by them while the rest of
the carriage descends still farther until the timbers <i>d</i> rest
on the keeps also. The track on the platform <i>a</i> is then at the
same level as that on <i>d</i>, and the car can be run off and replaced
by another. When the empty car is on, the carriage is lifted from the
keeps, but the platform <i>a</i> remains until the timbers <i>b</i>
pick it up, when the keeps are swung back out of the way and the
carriage is lowered.</p>

<p>Slope carriages usually have the tracks running crosswise so that the
car is pushed on from the side instead of from the end.</p>

<h3 id="SKIP">SKIPS, OR GUNBOATS</h3>

<p><b>17. Skips</b> are self-dumping cars used for hoisting
material from shafts or slopes. In a vertical shaft, they run in
guide tracks; but in a slope they have wheels and run on a track like
a car. In the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, skips are called
<b>gunboats</b>.</p>

<p>As the skip is not detached from the hoisting rope, time is saved at
the top over that needed to unhook and hook the cars to the rope or to
remove and place the cars on the cage. But since dumping the material
into the skip and again on the surface produces considerable fine
material, skips, or gunboats, are seldom used for any material, such
as coal, that is often lessened in value by being broken. The skip, or
gunboat, shown in <a href="#FIG_14A">Fig. 14</a> is closed along the top <i>a</i>
and open at the end <i>b</i>, which is cut at about the angle of the slope in which
it is to be used, so as to remain practically level during the hoist.
It is made of sheet iron, the bottom, sides, and top being stiffened by
angle or <b>T</b> irons, and the back stiffened and protected by 3-inch
planks, backed by 3" × 6" timbers. The wheels of a skip are fixed on
the axles, which run in journal boxes, thus insuring smoother running
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18A"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
than is obtained with loose wheels. The details of the journal
bearings, as shown in <a href="#FIG_15A">Fig. 15</a>, consist of three castings,
the bracket <i>a</i>, which is bolted or riveted to the gunboat, a pivot casting
<i>b</i>, and the bearing proper <i>c</i>. The bearing <i>c</i> rests
on the axle and carries, by means of trunnions <i>d</i>, the pivot
casting <i>b</i>, on the top of which is placed a rubber cushion
<i>e</i> to lessen the shocks between the casting and the bracket.</p>

<p><b>18. Method of Loading Skips.</b>&mdash;In <a href="#FIG_16A">Fig. 16</a>, a skip <i>a</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19A"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
is shown in a slope standing immediately below a level where a car
<i>b</i> is ready to have its load dumped into the skip. Instead of
dumping the mine car directly into the skip, a bin is frequently
provided at the level station, or landing, into which the mine cars
are dumped and from which the material is loaded into the skip through
suitable chutes. The use of such bins makes the hoisting of material
largely independent of the working conditions on the levels and the
hoisting can be more systematically and satisfactorily carried on.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>If the material comes to the slope as shown in <a href="#FIG_17A">Fig. 17</a>, it
is necessary to let down a bridge <i>a</i>, on which the car runs, in order to reach
the skip. After the car is dumped, the bridge is lifted out of the way
into the dotted position, so as to leave the slope unobstructed.</p>

<p><b>19. Method of Dumping Skips.</b> To dump a skip at the
surface, the tracks are extended above the slope mouth, as shown in
Figs. <a href="#FIG_18A">18</a> and <a href="#FIG_19A">19</a>, and are arranged
so that the material may be dumped directly into a bin or into cars as desired.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20A"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>In the arrangement shown in <a href="#FIG_18A">Fig. 18</a>, the front wheel of
the skip strikes a stop <i>a</i> and, since the bail of the skip is pivoted far
down toward the lower end, as the rope continues to pull, the rear of
the skip is raised and the material is dumped. The objection to this
method is that if the rope is slightly overwound the skip is pulled off
the track and does not then right itself on the track when the rope is released.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_18A" src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="571" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the Lake Superior iron and copper region, many of the dumps are
built as shown in <a href="#FIG_19A">Fig. 19</a>. In this dump, the rails of the
main track <i>a</i> are curved as shown at <i>b</i>; a short distance back of the
beginning of this curve, another track <i>c</i> begins outside the
track <i>a</i> and runs in a straight line parallel to the inclination
of the hoist. The track <i>c</i> is of a wider gauge than <i>a</i>, and
the rear wheels of the skip have a wider tread than the front, so that
they will run on <i>c</i> while the front wheels take the curved track
until they strike the stop <i>d</i>. The rear of the skip will thus be
raised and the material dumped. There are but two tracks in the main
part of the slope.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21A"></a>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_19A" src="images/i_121a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="529" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23A"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
In the method illustrated in <a href="#FIG_20A">Fig. 20</a>, the rear and front
wheels have the same tread, but the rear axle is longer than the front and has
rollers <i>a</i> on each side. These strike the track <i>b</i>, and
while the front wheels follow the curved track <i>c</i> these rollers
run on the track <i>b</i> and thus raise the rear end of the skip.</p>

<p><b>20. Skip Cage.</b>&mdash;Where a self-dumping skip is to be used
in a vertical or highly inclined shaft and it is desired to use safety
catches, the skip <i>a</i> is mounted in a cage or frame <i>b</i>, <a href="#FIG_21A">Fig. 21</a>,
similar to the self-dumping cage, <a href="#FIG_11A">Fig. 11</a>. The skip being pivoted
at <i>c</i> one side of the center, and resting on the frame of the
cage, tends to remain upright until it reaches the dump; but for safety
it is sometimes locked in place by the latch <i>d</i>, which hooks
over the pin <i>e</i>. When near the top, the roller <i>f</i> on the
end of the latch <i>d</i> comes in contact with a bar that depresses
the roller and thus unhooks the latch. The roller <i>g</i> enters and
travels along the guide rails <i>h</i>, tipping the skip. There are two
rollers <i>g</i>, one on either side of the skip. The nose <i>i</i> is
temporarily caught on the roller <i>j</i>, thus stopping the movement
of the skip sidewise and away from the upright guide.</p>

<h3 id="BUCKET">BUCKETS</h3>

<p><b>21. Buckets</b>, such as are used for hoisting material
during shaft sinking, are continued in use after mining begins when the
amount of material to be hoisted is small.</p>

<h3 id="LOCKS">CAR LOCKS</h3>

<p><b>22.</b> Several methods of keeping the car on the cage have already
been illustrated: by chains, <a href="#FIG_8A">Fig. 8</a>; by bails,
Figs. <a href="#FIG_9A">9</a>, <a href="#FIG_10A">10</a>, and
<a href="#FIG_12A">12</a>; by omitting sections of the rail under
the car wheels, <a href="#FIG_11A">Fig. 11</a>; and by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24A"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
dropping a portion of the platform, <a href="#FIG_13A">Fig. 13</a>. A very common
way is merely to put a pin through the hole in the drawbar and into the floor
of the cage. Another common device consists of a brake block that fits
between the wheels and can be thrown in from the side by a lever when
the car is in place. Another device consists of a yoke, which, by
means of a lever, is raised when the car is in place so that it passes
about the axle and thus holds the car. A device frequently used on
self-dumping cages is shown in <a href="#FIG_22A">Fig. 22</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_22A" src="images/i_124.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="656" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22</span></p>
</div>

<p>The curved bars <i>a</i> of iron, which just fit around the car wheels
as shown, are attached to the loose bars <i>b</i>, on the ends of which
are the weights <i>c</i>. When the cage is at the bottom, these weights
strike on a cross-piece and are raised to the position shown by the
dotted lines, throwing out the bars <i>b</i>, as shown by the dotted
line, thus releasing the wheels. The devices shown in
Figs. <a href="#FIG_11A">11</a>, <a href="#FIG_13A">13</a>, and
<a href="#FIG_22A">22</a> do not come into action until the cage leaves
the landing and the cars must, therefore, be watched until that time.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25A"></a>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<h3 id="GUIDES">CAGE GUIDES</h3>

<p><b>23. Guides</b> are used in all vertical shafts of any
considerable depth and in many highly inclined shafts to keep the cage
from swinging about and striking the sides of the shaft. They are made
of wooden rails, iron rails, or wire ropes. In American mines, timber
guides predominate, although some iron ones are used, and for small
shafts at ore mines wire-rope guides are common. In English mines, wire
ropes, called <i>conductors</i>, are very largely used. This difference
in practice is probably due to the fact that in English mines the
shafts are usually round and the cages are rectangular. In such a
shaft, the wire-rope conductors hang from the head-frame without any
cross-bracing, but they require a strong support, as both the weight
of the ropes and the strain to give the necessary tension come on the
head-frame. When both the shaft and the cage are rectangular, as in
most American mines, timber guides are easily put in and they offer a
good surface for the safety catches to grip.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_23A" src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="445" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23</span></p>
</div>

<p>Wooden guides are always rectangular in cross-section and in the United
States are usually made of yellow pine or other long-grained wood that
does not splinter easily; in some localities, oak or some of the other
harder woods are used. There is no fixed size for cage guides, but 4" ×
4", 6" × 8", 8" × 10", and 4¼" × 11" timbers are frequently used.</p>

<p>The guides are firmly fastened to the shaft buntons with lagscrews or
with bolts countersunk into the guide so as to be clear of the shoes,
and, to secure safety with speed in hoisting, the ends of the guides
must be put together with joints that are not liable to displacement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26A"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
and that offer no projections to the shoes in passing. The buntons
to which the guides are secured must be so firmly fastened that they
cannot get out of place, and the guides must be set as nearly as
possible in a straight line, because if they are crooked the cage
is thrown back and forth as it travels along them and this not only
increases the strain on the hoisting rope and engine, but sooner or
later loosens and misplaces the guide. <a href="#FIG_23A">Fig. 23</a>
shows a plan of a cage with the bunton <i>A</i>, guides <i>B</i>, and
cage shoes <i>C</i> in their normal positions.</p>

<h3 id="KEEPS">LANDING FANS OR KEEPS</h3>

<p><b>24.</b> In order to take the strain off the hoisting rope while a
cage or skip is being loaded or unloaded, a mechanism to support the
cage is placed at the top and at any level of the mine where loading is
done, excepting at the bottom level where all that is usually required
are the cross-timbers for the cage to rest on. These supports have
different names in various localities, being known as <i>fans</i>,
<i>keeps</i>, <i>cage rests</i>, <i>landing dogs</i>, <i>landing
chairs</i>, <i>wings</i>, etc. Their use increases the safety of caging.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> A common form of keeps is shown in <a href="#FIG_24A">Fig. 24</a>.
The cage <i>a</i> rests on four square bars of iron <i>b</i>, one under each
corner of the cage. These bars have an eye or hub at the lower end
and are keyed to the shafts <i>d</i>, which rest in cast-steel boxes.
The levers <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, which are also keyed to the ends of
the shafts <i>d</i>, are connected by a rod <i>g</i>. Chains <i>h</i>
prevent the fans from moving too far under the cage. When the cage
is to be lowered, it is first lifted clear of the fans and the lever
<i>e</i> is moved into the dotted position, thus moving the fans
<i>b</i> out of the way and permitting the cage to be lowered. The
inside of the fans have no projections, and the operating mechanism
is such that no harm would come if they were left in the shaft and a
hoist were made, as the cage would open out the fans and pass through
them without any trouble. If, however, the fans are not drawn back at
all the headings in the shaft when the cage is lowered, great damage
results when the cage strikes the projecting fans. To avoid the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27A"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
possibility of such an accident, fans have been devised that fall back
out of line of the shaft as soon as the weight of the cage is removed
from them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_24A" src="images/i_127.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="555" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>26. Hydrostatic Fans.</b>&mdash;Most fans in use are built on the
same principle as those just described, although the details of their
construction may vary. An objection that can be raised against them is
that, with large cages and heavy loads, the jar caused by letting the
cage down on such a rigid support is very hard on the cage. All cages,
particularly heavy ones, suffer much more wear from being landed too
suddenly than from the strains of hoisting. For this reason, it is
advisable to make the upper parts as light as compatible with strength
and the side pieces stronger than needed for the actual strains to
which they are subjected. Hydraulic fans, <a href="#FIG_25A">Fig. 25</a>, have successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28A"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
overcome this trouble. The cylinder shown is one of four on which the
cage rests. The eye at the lower end fits on a bar by means of which
the cylinders are moved backwards and forwards similar to the motion of
the fans <i>b</i>, <a href="#FIG_24A">Fig. 24</a>. In <a href="#FIG_25A">Fig. 25 (<i>a</i>)</a>,
the cage is shown as about to rest on the jaw <i>a</i>. As the cage
settles, it pushes the plunger <i>b</i> downwards, but this action is
resisted by oil in the cylinder at <i>c</i>. At first, this resistance
is very slight, because the <b>V</b>-shaped grooves <i>d</i> in the
plunger, which are of considerable size at the end of the plunger,
allow the oil to escape freely into the upper chamber <i>e</i>. These
grooves, however, taper down to nothing, so that the flow of oil
through them decreases until none can pass except by leakage around the
plunger. This allows the plunger with its load to settle slowly to the
bottom, as shown in <a href="#FIG_25A">Fig. 25 (<i>b</i>)</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>If now the cage is lifted and the weight thus removed from the jaw
<i>a</i>, the spring <i>g</i> pushes the plunger <i>b</i> outwards and
allows the oil to run from <i>e</i> back into <i>c</i>.</p>

<p><b>27. Pneumatic Fans.</b>&mdash;A pneumatic fan, shown in section in
<a href="#FIG_26A">Fig. 26</a>, is one in which the shock of the landing is partially
relieved by a cushion of compressed air. The fan is keyed at the bottom to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29A"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
shaft <i>a</i> that rotates it, as in <a href="#FIG_24A">Fig. 24</a>. The cylinder
<i>b</i> contains the plunger <i>c</i>, which is kept at the top limit of its
motion by the spring <i>d</i>. When the cage lands in the jaw <i>e</i>,
the plunger descends, compressing the air in the cylinder <i>b</i>. The
air escapes slowly through the ¹/₁₆-inch hole <i>f</i>, thus allowing
the cage to settle into place with very little shock. These fans should
be made of wrought-iron or cast-steel so as not to be easily broken.</p>

   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>28. Cage Chairs.</b>&mdash;In the case of a cage required to stop at a
large number of levels, it is expensive to provide fans at each level,
and to obviate this a strong steel bar or dog may be used under each
corner of the cage, all four bars being connected to a lever on the
cage, by means of which they can be thrown out at will so as to rest
on supports provided at each level. <a href="#FIG_27A">Fig. 27</a> shows Gray’s patent
cage chair, which operates on this principle. The sliding bars <i>a</i> are
connected by the cross-bars <i>b</i>, which are pivoted at the center
and operated by the bar <i>c</i> through the links <i>d</i>. By moving
the lever <i>e</i> into the position shown, the bars <i>a</i> are
thrown out so as to rest in notches or on wall plates in the shaft. The
springs <i>f</i>, through the cross-bars <i>b</i>, force the sliding
bars <i>a</i> back under the cage when the lever <i>e</i> is released.</p>

<h3 id="HEAD">HEAD-FRAMES</h3>

<p><b>29.</b> A <b>head-frame</b> of wood, iron, or steel is built over a
shaft or slope mouth to carry the sheaves over which the hoisting ropes
are conducted from the mine to the drum of the hoisting engine; it also
usually carries the upper portion of the cage guides or, in the case of
a slope, the tracks for cars.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30A"></a>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31A"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
A head-frame must be strong enough to bear the strain brought on it due
to the total load hoisted and the pull of the engine in hoisting this
load; it must also be rigid in construction to withstand the severe
vibration and shock to which it is subjected on account of the rapid
hoisting and the jar due to the landing of the cages.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_28A" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="369" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28</span></p>
</div>

<p>The amount and direction of stresses that a head-frame must resist are
usually determined by applying the parallelogram of forces as follows:
<a href="#FIG_28A">Fig. 28</a> is a simple head-frame at a slope; <i>a</i> is the
drum of the hoisting engine with the rope coming from its upper side and running
over the head-sheave <i>b</i> down to the slope cage <i>c</i>. Assuming
that the angles <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> made by the two portions of the
rope with the horizontal are equal, and that the pull on each part of
the rope is 20,000 pounds, to determine the amount and direction of
the resultant of the two rope pulls, proceed as follows: Extend the
rope lines to the point of intersection <i>g</i> and from there lay
off the two lines <i>g h</i> and <i>g k</i>, to some definite scale,
representing the pull of the rope. If a scale of 2,000 pounds to ⅒ inch
is taken (⅒ inch = 2,000 pounds), <i>g h</i> and <i>g k</i> will each be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32A"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
1 inch long. Complete the parallelogram by drawing <i>h l</i> parallel
to <i>g k</i> and <i>k l</i> parallel to <i>g h</i>. The diagonal
<i>g l</i> represents the direction and amount of the force acting on
the head-frame due to the pull of the two portions of the rope. The
diagonal, by measurement, is 1½ inches or ¹⁵/₁₀ inches long, and since
each tenth inch equals 2,000 pounds, the stress on the head-frame in
the line of the diagonal <i>g l</i> is 2,000 × 15 = 30,000 pounds. The
figure also shows that the direction of this force is vertical, hence
there is no tendency for the frame to be pulled over to either side
and, theoretically, side bracing is not needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_29A" src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="541" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>30.</b> Consider now the case of a vertical shaft, <a href="#FIG_29A">Fig. 29</a>,
in which, as before, <i>a</i> is the drum, <i>b</i> the head-sheave,
<i>c</i> the cage, and <i>d</i> the head-frame, and assume the same
pull of 20,000 pounds on each part of the rope. As before, extend the
lines of the rope, which are the lines of force along which the pulls
due to the engine and the load act, until they intersect at <i>g</i>.
From this point lay off on these lines distances representing the
stresses in the rope to any scale. Using the same scale as before, ⅒
inch = 2,000 pounds, the lines <i>g h</i> and <i>g k</i> representing
the two forces will be each 1 inch long. Completing the parallelogram
by drawing <i>h l</i> parallel to <i>g k</i>, and <i>k l</i> parallel
to <i>g h</i>, and drawing the diagonal <i>g l</i> through <i>g</i>,
the resultant, <i>g l</i> = ¹⁹/₁₀ inches, represents a stress of 38,000
pounds. The direction of the resultant is also determined, being in the
line of the diagonal <i>g l</i>. If the head-frame shown in <a href="#FIG_28A">Fig. 28</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33A"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
were used for this case, it would be overturned by this resultant force,
unless the leg on the opposite side of the shaft from the engine
were securely anchored, so an inclined brace <i>m</i> is added to
resist this overturning action. The resultant of all forces acting
on the head-frame should generally fall within the structure if the
greatest stability is to be secured, but when this cannot be done it is
necessary to resist the overturning pull by anchoring the head-frame to
its foundations much more securely than is the case where the resultant
falls within the structure.</p>

<p>The direction of the resultant force may be obtained by drawing a
line through the intersection of the lines of action of the forces at
<i>g</i> and the center of the head-sheave <i>b</i>, as may be seen in
Figs. <a href="#FIG_28A">28</a> and <a href="#FIG_29A">29</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_30A" src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>31.</b> In Figs. <a href="#FIG_28A">28</a> and
<a href="#FIG_29A">29</a>, the pull of one hoisting rope running
from the top of the drum was considered, but in most cases it is
necessary to consider the pull from two hoisting ropes, one running
from the top and one from the bottom of the drum <i>f</i>, as shown in
<a href="#FIG_30A">Fig. 30</a>. <i>a b</i> and <i>a′ b′</i> represent the directions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34A"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
of action of the two forces acting on the hoisting ropes, while the two
vertical forces <i>a c</i> and <i>a′ c</i> acting down the shaft are
approximately equal to the two forces acting toward the drum. There
are, therefore, two resultants <i>a d</i> and <i>a′ d′</i>, the
directions of which are determined by lines from <i>a</i> and <i>a′</i>
through the center of the sheave <i>e</i>. The amounts of these
resultant forces can be determined by the parallelogram of forces as
shown in Figs. 28 and 29. A resultant that is a mean between <i>a d</i>
and <i>a′ d′</i>, both in position and amount, is sometimes taken, or
the greater value as determined from <i>a d</i> or <i>a′ d′</i> and the
greatest inclination as given by <i>a′ d′</i> may be used, as being
the worst theoretical conditions to which the frame may be subjected.
A head-frame usually has a vertical post approximately parallel to
the vertical pull of the rope in the shaft, and an inclined member
<i>g h</i> approximately parallel to the resultant determined by the
parallelogram of forces. If <i>g h</i>, <a href="#FIG_30A">Fig. 30</a>, is parallel
to the resultant, the vertical leg <i>h i</i> is under no strain and merely
supports the end of <i>g h</i>. If the resultant falls between <i>g
h</i> and <i>h i</i>, both of these legs will be under compression.
If the resultant falls outside of <i>g h</i>, the leg <i>g h</i> will
be under compression and <i>h i</i> will be under tension. The head
frame will be most stable when the resultant falls between <i>g h</i>
and <i>h i</i>, but this cannot always be accomplished in building the
frame on account of the conditions at the head of the shaft; nor is it
always advisable to do so from structural considerations.</p>

<p id="ART_32"><b>32.</b> Since wood is much better adapted to withstand compressive
than tensile stresses and since steel is adapted to withstand either
tensile or compressive stresses, it is much more important that
the members of timber frame conform as closely as possible to the
theoretical line worked out in Figs. 28, 29, and 30 than in the case
of a steel frame. Take, for instance, the case shown in <a href="#FIG_31A">Fig. 31</a>,
where for some local reason it is impossible to put an inclined strut in or
near the line of the resultant stress to withstand the pull that tends
to overturn the head-frame. In a steel structure, <i>a</i> can very
easily be made a tension member by anchoring its lower end to a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35A"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
foundation. This resists the tendency to overturn and makes a very
stable structure. In practice, braces can generally be located parallel
to the line of resultant strain, <a href="#FIG_29A">Fig. 29</a>, or outside this
line, as shown in <a href="#FIG_30A">Fig. 30</a>, so that the strain due to the pull
of the rope will come mainly on the inclined brace and not on the upright. To distribute
the stress on the foot of the different parts of the frame, an inclined
brace is usually set farther from the shaft than the parallelogram of
forces locates it, and so placed that about two-thirds of the strain
due to the pull of the rope comes on the brace and one-third on the
upright parts of the frame. In order to give the frame a more stable
base and because the base must be larger than the top of the frame to
bring the foundations back from the shaft mouth, usually the members
<i>h i</i> are also slightly inclined.</p>

<p>Wherever permanency of head-frames is required, if steel is obtainable
at a price at all comparable with wood, steel structures are being
used, as timber frames rot.

<p class="f120"><b>TYPES OF HEAD-FRAMES</b></p>

<p><b>33.</b> There are three types of head-frame construction&mdash;<i>the</i>
<b>A</b> <i>type</i>, the <i>square type without an inclined brace</i>,
and the <i>square type with an inclined brace</i>.</p>

<p><b>34. A Type of Head-Frame</b>.&mdash;<a href="#FIG_32A">Fig. 32</a>
shows the construction of a triangular, or <b>A</b>-shaped, head-frame
of which (<i>a</i>) is a side elevation and (<i>b</i>) an end view.
This particular frame is largely used at anthracite mines, but the type
is one quite commonly used for timber frames, though the details of
construction vary in different localities. The height of the frame is
from 30 to 50 feet, and with direct-acting engines this height should
be sufficient to allow a play of at least two-thirds of a revolution
between the cage landing and the overwinding point. The posts <i>a</i>
are parallel to the hoisting rope <i>b</i> as it hangs down the shaft
and the inclined brace <i>c</i>, which resists any thrust that would
tend to rotate the head-frame, is parallel to the resultant pull of
the two parts of this rope <i>b</i>; the inclined braces <i>d</i>
stiffen the frame and help support the cross-timbers <i>m</i> that
support the cage guides <i>e</i>. The sills <i>f</i> are made of three
pieces of timber 8 inches by 14 inches in cross-section. The posts
<i>a</i> rest in cast-iron shoes <i>g</i> that are firmly bolted to
the posts and sills. The inclined braces <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> are fitted
with cast-iron shoes <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>. The post <i>a</i> and the two
braces <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> are held in place at the top of the frame by
the casting <i>j</i>, which also supports the pillow-block <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>The posts <i>a</i> and the brace <i>c</i> are made up of two pieces of
timber each 8 inches by 14 inches in cross-section. The brace <i>d</i>
consists of one piece of timber 8 inches by 14 inches in cross-section.
The transverse braces <i>l</i> consist of two pieces of timber 6 inches
by 14 inches in cross-section, bolted through the timbers <i>a</i> and
<i>c</i>. The supports <i>m</i> for the guides are single pieces of
8" × 8" timber. The center post, as shown in <a href="#FIG_32A">Fig. 32 (<i>b</i>)</a>,
is braced by the two pieces <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, which are supported by two
timbers <i>p</i>, <i>q</i> bolted to the two outside posts. The posts
<i>a</i> and the inclined braces <i>c</i> are further braced by the
tie-rods <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>u</i>, all of which are
fitted with turnbuckles, as shown at <i>v</i>. The different posts are
firmly bolted together, the bolts being fitted with cast-iron washers.

timber gallows frame used at many ore mines.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_34A">Fig. 34</a> shows a steel <b>A</b> frame, of which the principal
dimensions are as follows: height to sheave center 48 feet; base 33 feet 10 inches
by 56 feet. Legs <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are made of laced channels, as
are also the central upright posts and cross-braces. The forward
inclined legs are made of <b>I</b> beams. The weight of the frame is
98,000 pounds without the sheaves. The advantages claimed for this type
of design are that it gives a very strongly braced frame while using a
minimum of material. Also, in cases of overwinding, the cage goes over
the top of the frame without injury to the frame, and should men be
overwound they would fall only the height of the frame instead of being
crushed against the top.</p>

<p><b>35. Square Type Without Inclined Brace.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_35A">Fig. 35</a>
shows a steel frame in which the tendency to be overturned by the pull of
the rope is resisted by a nearly vertical tension leg as explained
in <a href="#ART_32"><b>Art. 32</b></a>. Each leg of the frame is built of channel
bars connected by lattice bracing, as shown, and the legs are stiffened by
horizontal channel cross-bars similarly braced and also by diagonal
tie-rods, provided with turnbuckles.</p>

<p>Springs are sometimes placed under the journals of the head-sheaves
to lessen the strain on the rope while starting the load; the 15-foot
head-sheaves of the Robinson deep mine at Johannesburg have locomotive
springs under the journal boxes, the actual load on each spring due to
the weight of the sheave, rope, skip, and rock being equal to about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40A"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
20,000 pounds; it was estimated that the sheave would thus be lowered
by the load on it, about 3 inches, which would be equal to an action
of a spring giving motion of 6 inches at the cage. Springs can often
be used both on the rope and under the sheave in the same plant to advantage.</p>

<p>Its principal dimensions are as follows: height to sheave center 59
feet 6 inches; base of tower 15 feet 8 inches by 14 feet; distance
of bottom of inclined leg from vertical post 48 feet. Each end post
<i>a</i> is composed of two channels, double-latticed. The horizontal
members <i>b</i> are <b>I</b> beams and each inclined member <i>c</i>
is made up of two angles. The inclined leg <i>d</i> is trussed as shown
and built of channel and angle beams, the main member being made of two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42A"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
channels, the incline and base members of the truss being made up of
two angles, and the short vertical member of two channels. The center
post of the tower is similar to the end posts, except that the uprights
are <b>I</b> beams instead of channels. The frame is designed for a
static weight of 16,000 pounds and for a maximum strain on the cable of
32,000 pounds.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_37A">Fig. 37</a> shows a frame of similar form, but in which the
landing platform is placed at a height above the surface, so that the cars
hoisted can be run off on a trestle and thus be delivered at the top of
a car, breaker, tipple, or ore house. Its principal dimensions are as
follows: height to sheave center 75 feet; base 40 feet 11¾ inches by
21 feet 8½ inches. The leg <i>a</i> is made of two angles. The bracing
leg <i>b</i> is built of two angles. The diagonal braces <i>c</i> are
single angles. The horizontal braces are angles or channels of various
sizes depending on the stresses.</p>

<p><b>37.</b> The <b>head-sheave</b> is supported directly on top of
the main frame, as shown in Figs. 32, 34, 36, and 37, or a small
superstructure <i>a</i> is built on top of the main frame, as shown in
<a href="#FIG_38A">Fig. 38</a>, so that the base of the sheave journals is
perpendicular to the resultant pull on the frame, that is, to the
theoretical direction of the inclined leg of the frame if one is used.</p>

<p><b>38.</b> Timber frames are usually built by the mining company from
its own designs. Steel frames are generally built by the structural
steel companies from detailed plans and designs furnished by the mining
company, or from a skeleton diagram furnished by the mining company,
giving the loads on the rope and the general conditions about the shaft
to which the frame must conform, the frame being then designed and
erected in detail by the steel company.</p>

<p><b>39. Enclosing Head-Frames.</b>&mdash;Head-frames are sometimes wholly
or partially enclosed to protect them and the men from the weather.
A covering of boards is warmest. All woodwork should be painted with
fireproof paint and ample means for extinguishing fire should be
provided. A covering of corrugated sheet iron well painted on both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43A"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
to prevent rusting is often used instead of wood and lessens the danger
of fire, but is not as warm a covering as wood.</p>

</div>

<p><b>40.</b> In many states, it is required by law that the top of the
shaft be protected by a fence or by gates to prevent persons falling
down the shaft. This protection is secured at the sides of head-frames
by extra timbers or beams forming part of the frame, or by means of a
fence placed near the sides of the frame. The ends of the shaft are
protected by a bar placed across uprights, by gates that swing like an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44A"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
ordinary door, or more generally by vertical sliding gates that are
raised by the cage when it comes to the surface and drop into place
when the cage descends. Similar gates, doors, or bars should be used at
all landings below the surface.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>HEAD-FRAME SPECIFICATIONS</b></p>

<p><b>41.</b> The following is a sample set of specifications for a steel
head-frame to be built from detailed plans furnished by the mining company.</p>

<p>This head-frame to be made from drawings to be furnished by the&mdash;&mdash;
Coal Company, and placed on foundations furnished by said company.</p>

<p><b>Material.</b>&mdash;Structure to be built throughout of soft structural
steel, net strength 55,000 to 62,000 pounds per square inch; elastic
limit not less than 30,000 pounds per square inch; elongation, 25 per
cent.; bending test, bend flat on itself without fracture.</p>

<p>Builder agrees to guarantee structure to withstand strains specified
on drawings with factor of safety of 10, to provide for possible
overwinding or sticking in shaft.</p>

<p>No steel shall be used less than ¼ inch thick except for lining or
filling vacant places.</p>

<p><b>Workmanship.</b>&mdash;The tower to be built in a neat and workman-like
manner. The pitch of the rivets (distance between centers) shall not
exceed 6 inches or sixteen times the thinnest plate, nor be less than
three diameters of the rivets.</p>

shall not be less than 1¼ inches, except for bars less than 2½ inches
wide; when practicable it shall be at least two diameters of the
rivet. All rivet holes shall be spaced and punched, so that when the
several parts are assembled together a rivet of ¹/₁₆ inch less diameter
than the hole can be entered hot into any hole, without reaming or
drifting. The rivets when driven should fill the holes. The heads must
be rounded; they must be full and neatly made, and be concentric to
the rivet hole, and thoroughly pinch the connecting pieces together.
Field riveting must be reduced to a minimum. All joints and connections
shall be neatly made, the several parts to be brought together without
twists, bends, or open joints.</p>

<p><b>Inspection.</b>&mdash;All facilities for inspecting the material and
workmanship shall be given by the builders during the erection of the

<h3 id="HOOKS">DETACHING HOOKS</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><b>42.</b> In hoisting, there is more or less danger of overwinding
or lifting the cage too far, and dashing it against the top of the
head-frame, or if the top is open the cage may be pulled entirely over
the top. <b>Detaching hooks</b> are intended to prevent this. Several
varieties of such hooks are made, which differ from each other only
in their smaller details. In all of them, detachment is effected by
passing the rope through a circular hole in an iron plate or through an
iron cylinder, the diameter of which is sufficient to allow the upper
portion of the hooks to pass through when passing upwards, but the
lower portion is made larger and so arranged that when this larger part
strikes the plate the upper portion is forced open and the hoisting
rope released. After the upper part has been thus opened, it is too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47A"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
large to pass back through the opening and the plate and the cage is
therefore held suspended. <a href="#FIG_39A">Fig. 39</a> shows such
a hook. It consists of two outside fixed plates slightly narrower
at the top than the diameter of the hole in the disengaging plate
<i>h</i>. Between the frame plates <i>a</i> are two inner plates
<i>b</i> that move about a strong pin <i>c</i> passing through both
plates <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, but near the bottoms there are two
projections <i>d</i> to prevent the hook from passing entirely through
the hole. The winding rope is attached to the top shackle <i>e</i> and
the cage to the lower shackle <i>f</i>. When the two movable plates
<i>b</i> are closed as tightly as possible at the top about the pin
of the shackle <i>e</i>, they are secured by a copper pin <i>g</i>.
In case of overwinding, when the hook passes into the hole of the
disengaging plate <i>h</i>, the two projections <i>k</i> on plates
<i>b</i> are pressed inwards, shearing off the copper pin <i>g</i> and
allowing the plates <i>b</i> to turn about the central bolt <i>c</i>,
thus releasing the shackle <i>e</i>. The plates <i>b</i> are then in
such a position that the projections <i>l</i> on them cannot pass down
through the hole. The cage then hangs by the hooks from the disengaging
plate, and the rope passes on. An objection raised against this hook
is that, being constructed of plates, there is considerable surface in
contact between the moving parts, and unless they are regularly taken
apart and oiled, there is danger of their rusting firmly together.</p>

<p>In England, detaching hooks are used quite commonly, and also in
certain parts of the Central Basin in the United States, but they have
not yet been generally adopted throughout the United States.</p>

<p><b>43.</b> It is claimed by many that such devices inspire the
engineer with a misleading feeling of security; that they are more or
less complicated in construction and so need care, and destroy the
simplicity of the plant; that they may be the direct cause of accident
by introducing new elements of danger; that they add to the cost; and
that they are not thoroughly reliable. Again, it is held that the
surest prevention of overwinding is obtained by the employment of a
sober, reliable, and competent engineer, who is held personally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48A"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
responsible for overwinding accidents; by having a good brake and an
engine thoroughly under the control of the engineer; by a reliable
method of indicating the position of the cage; by sufficient height
to head-sheaves to allow of considerable hoisting over and above that
necessary for landing.</p>

<h3 id="SIGNALS">SIGNALING</h3>

<p><b>44.</b> Some method must be provided for communicating between the
bottom or any level of a shaft and the top landing or the engine room,
also between the top landing and the engine room, so that the hoisting
engineer may be notified when both the head-man and foot-man are ready
for him to hoist. A common method of signaling is by means of a gong,
bell, or triangle placed in the engine room and connected by a wire
or small wire-rope with the point from which it is desired to signal.
Attempts have been made in different localities and by different
associations to adopt a standard code of hoisting signals, and while it
would be advantageous if this could be done, none of the attempts made
have been entirely successful. Although there is no uniform system of
signals, one bell generally means stop, two bells lower, three bells
hoist, and four bells hoist men.</p>

</div>

<p><b>45. Hammer-and-Plate Signal.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_40A">Fig. 40</a> shows a
hammer-and-plate signal, the plate being a piece of boiler iron or steel. The hammer is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
often located beneath the plate instead of above, as shown. Another
style of hammer-and-plate is shown in <a href="#FIG_41A">Fig. 41</a>. The hammer
is made of 2-inch square iron and heavy enough to balance the weight of wire
hanging in the shaft and to take the sag out of the horizontal wire
connecting the top of the shaft with the lever <i>a</i>. A simple dial
turned by a ratchet motion attached to the lever <i>a</i> is sometimes
used to show the number of strokes, and thus check the number counted
by the engineer. The dial is reset by the engineer as soon as he
understands the signal.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p><b>46. Electric Bells.</b>&mdash;Electric bells operated by push buttons are
rapidly coming into use for mine signaling on account of the ease and
completeness with which such a system can be installed. Electric flash
lights are also extensively used for signaling purposes. The principle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50A"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
of action and details of the wiring for electric signals and flash
lights have been described in <i>Transmission, Signaling, and Lighting</i>.</p>

<p><b>47. Speaking Tubes.</b>&mdash;The laws of certain states require
speaking tubes, in addition to the ordinary means of signaling. These
speaking tubes are generally made of 2-inch iron pipe and are from 300
to 1,500 feet long, and are often provided with whistles at the end
of the pipe and at each level of the mine, by which the attention of
persons at any level can be attracted or the whistle may be omitted and
the attention of persons attracted merely by rapping on the pipe with a
piece of iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img id="FIG_43A" src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="579" />
   <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>48. Pneumatic Gong Signal.</b>&mdash;<a href="#FIG_42A">Fig. 42</a> shows an
attachment that can be connected to a speaking tube and that is widely used for
signaling. It consists of a brass cylinder <i>a</i> fitted with a piston <i>b</i>
containing valves <i>c</i>. The gong <i>d</i> is attached to the
cylinder <i>e</i> inside of which the clapper <i>f</i> fits loosely.
When the piston is pushed inwards, as shown by the arrow, by means
of the handle, the air in the cylinder and in the pipe <i>h</i> is
compressed and forces the clapper <i>f</i> upwards against the gong
<i>d</i>. The arrangement of these gongs in the mine is shown in <a href="#FIG_43A">Fig.43.</a>
A cylinder and whistle are usually placed at each landing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51A"></a>[Pg 51]</span> and a
gong and whistle in the engine room, though, if desired, a cylinder,
whistle, and gong may be placed at each landing and in the engine room.</p>

<p><b>49. Telephones.</b>&mdash;Telephones connecting the different
levels with the top and the engine room are now frequently used in
connection with other signal systems, but they are not as well adapted
as bells or gongs for rapid-hoisting signaling.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
